# Implement the Cycles Protocol

The Cycles Protocol is open. The reference server ([`runcycles/cycles-server`](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-server)) is Apache 2.0 and validated against the spec, but it is not the only conformant implementation possible. Anyone can build a server that speaks the same wire format.

This page is the entry point for that work.

## Who this is for

- **Framework maintainers** — LangGraph, Temporal, agent runtimes, orchestrators that want first-class runtime budget authority without proxying every call to an external service.
- **Infrastructure teams** — operating an internal budget system already (custom rate limiter, cost tracker, action governance) and wanting Cycles-compatible client interop without replacing what works.
- **OSS contributors** — building adapters, alternative servers in other languages, or instrumented variants for specific deployment models (FaaS, edge, embedded).
- **Vendors with overlapping scope** — observability, cost tracking, identity governance vendors who want to add reserve-commit semantics to their existing platform.

If "should this specific next agent action proceed, given everything already consumed?" is a question your platform needs to answer, the protocol is the wire format for that question.

## Why a separate implementation might make sense

The reference Cycles server covers the canonical case: self-hosted, Java/Spring Boot, Redis-backed, multi-tenant. Reasons to implement separately:

- **Bespoke runtime requirements** — your stack already runs on Postgres, FoundationDB, DynamoDB, or an in-process state engine; you want budget authority co-located.
- **Integration with existing budget systems** — you've shipped a quota service for traditional API limits and want to expose it under the Cycles wire format so AI-agent SDKs work transparently.
- **Language / platform constraints** — embedded systems, FaaS edge runtimes, mobile / on-device agents where Java + Redis isn't viable.
- **Principled reasons** — you want a second independent implementation in the wild for protocol robustness (the OpenTelemetry multi-implementation pattern).

Cycles' reference server is fine; *protocol robustness* is what comes from multiple implementations testing each other against the same conformance suite.

## The minimum implementation surface

The authoritative statement of what's required lives in [`CONFORMANCE.md`](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-protocol/blob/main/CONFORMANCE.md) — read that first. The current target requires a small core runtime + a cross-plane set, plus a smaller recommended set that well-rounded servers ship. Below is the surface at time of writing; if `CONFORMANCE.md` and this page disagree, **the spec wins**.

### Core runtime (MUST)

From [`cycles-protocol-v0.yaml`](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-protocol/blob/main/cycles-protocol-v0.yaml):

| Operation | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **createReservation** | `POST /v1/reservations` | Atomically lock budget across all affected scopes before action |
| **commitReservation** | `POST /v1/reservations/{reservation_id}/commit` | Settle the actual cost; release the unused portion |
| **releaseReservation** | `POST /v1/reservations/{reservation_id}/release` | Release the full reservation without spending (cancel) |
| **extendReservation** | `POST /v1/reservations/{reservation_id}/extend` | TTL heartbeat for long-running operations |

### Cross-plane (MUST)

From [`cycles-governance-admin-v0.1.25.yaml`](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-protocol/blob/main/cycles-governance-admin-v0.1.25.yaml). The admin spec is mostly the reference shape (tenant / budget / policy / key CRUD) and you can diverge there — but the cross-plane operations below carry an explicit `x-conformance: normative` label and MUST follow the spec contract:

1. `GET /v1/admin/events` — **listEvents**
2. `GET /v1/admin/events/{event_id}` — **getEvent**
3. `POST /v1/admin/webhooks/{subscription_id}/replay` — **replayEvents**
4. `GET /v1/events` — **listTenantEvents** (tenant-scoped)
5. `GET /v1/admin/webhooks/{subscription_id}/deliveries` — **listWebhookDeliveries**
6. `GET /v1/webhooks/{subscription_id}/deliveries` — **listTenantWebhookDeliveries** (tenant-scoped)
7. `GET /v1/balances` — **getBalances** (admin-plane view)
8. `GET /v1/auth/introspect` — **introspectAuth**

### Recommended (SHOULD)

Well-rounded servers also implement these (from `cycles-protocol-v0.yaml`):

- `decide` — preflight budget check without reservation
- `listReservations` / `getReservation` — recovery and inspection
- `createEvent` — direct-debit event submission

You can ship without these and still claim conformance against the current target, but most clients expect them.

## The four core invariants

Spec compliance isn't just endpoint coverage — it's behavior under the hood. Per `CONFORMANCE.md`:

1. **Atomic reservation across scopes** — when a reservation locks tenant + workspace + run budgets, it locks all three or none. No partial locks.
2. **Concurrency-safe enforcement** — shared budgets MUST NOT be oversubscribed under concurrent reserve calls. The reference server uses Lua-scripted Redis operations; alternative implementations need equivalent atomicity guarantees in their backing store.
3. **Idempotent commit and release** — every commit / release MUST be safe to retry. The same action MUST NOT settle twice. Idempotency keys carry the contract.
4. **Unit consistency** — reservations and commits MUST validate and preserve unit denomination (USD_MICROCENTS, TOKENS, CREDITS, RISK_POINTS). Cross-unit operations MUST return `UNIT_MISMATCH` (400).

These are the contracts client SDKs and downstream systems rely on. An implementation that returns the right HTTP codes but lets concurrent reservations oversubscribe is non-conformant in spirit even if it passes a naive endpoint test.

## Error semantics

Implementations MUST return the exact HTTP status + `error` code pairs from `cycles-protocol-v0.yaml` §ERROR SEMANTICS. The full set:

- `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` — 409
- `OVERDRAFT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` — 409
- `IDEMPOTENCY_MISMATCH` — 409
- `RESERVATION_FINALIZED` — 409
- `RESERVATION_EXPIRED` — 410
- `UNIT_MISMATCH` — 400
- `NOT_FOUND` — 404
- `DEBT_OUTSTANDING` — 409

Clients route on these codes — returning a generic 500 or a custom error string breaks the protocol contract even if the underlying behavior is correct.

Action-governance error codes (`ACTION_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`, `ACTION_KIND_NOT_ALLOWED`, `ACTION_KIND_DENIED`) are documented in upcoming spec extensions; check `CONFORMANCE.md` for whether they're currently MUST or SHOULD against the active target.

## Authentication and tenancy

Authenticate via the `X-Cycles-API-Key` header, per [`cycles-protocol-v0.yaml`](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-protocol/blob/main/cycles-protocol-v0.yaml) §AUTH & TENANCY. How API keys are provisioned, rotated, or scoped to permission sets is implementation-specific — but tenant isolation MUST be enforced.

The reference server uses a permissions model with named scopes (`reservations:create`, `balances:read`, `admin:write`, etc.). Alternative implementations can use any equivalent authorization model as long as tenant isolation holds.

## Get help

The protocol is small but has subtle behavioral requirements. If you're implementing and have a spec question, edge case, or suspect a contradiction:

- **Email a maintainer** — [founder@runcycles.io](mailto:founder@runcycles.io) for protocol design / clarification questions
- **Open a spec issue** — [`runcycles/cycles-protocol/issues`](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-protocol/issues) for ambiguity, contradiction, or proposed clarifications

A founder reads every email and issue.

## Why this matters

Protocol > tool.

Every framework, vendor, and platform that implements the Cycles Protocol speaks the same wire format. Client SDKs work against any conformant server. Operators can switch implementations without touching application code. The category — runtime budget authority over AI agents — has a single, open, version-stable contract that transcends any individual product.

OpenTelemetry won observability by being the protocol every vendor implemented. The team that owns the protocol owns the category — and the protocol only earns that ownership when multiple implementations validate the same wire format against the same conformance suite.

If you build a Cycles-compatible server, you make the protocol stronger. That's the work.

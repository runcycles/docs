# Scope Misconfiguration and Budget Leaks

A failure mode where budget is consumed from unintended scopes due to misconfigured subject fields, or where budget is not properly tracked because scopes don't match.

## The incident

A team sets up per-workspace budgets but their application doesn't consistently pass the `workspace` field in reservations. Some calls include `workspace=prod`, others omit it entirely. The result: calls without a workspace field only check the tenant-level budget, bypassing the workspace limit entirely.

### Example

**Budget setup:**

```
tenant:acme-corp                    → $100/month
tenant:acme-corp/workspace:prod     → $50/month
```

**Application code (inconsistent):**

```python
# Route A: Includes workspace — checks both scopes
@cycles(estimate=2000000, action_kind="llm.completion",
        action_name="gpt-4o", workspace="prod")
def route_a(prompt):
    ...

# Route B: Missing workspace — only checks tenant scope
@cycles(estimate=2000000, action_kind="llm.completion",
        action_name="gpt-4o")
def route_b(prompt):
    ...
```

Route B spends against `tenant:acme-corp` but never touches `tenant:acme-corp/workspace:prod`. The workspace budget appears underutilized while the tenant budget drains from both routes.

## Why this matters

- **Budget bypass.** If the workspace budget is meant to limit production spend, calls that skip the workspace field are unaccounted for at that level.
- **Misleading balances.** The workspace balance report shows less spending than actually occurred. Operators think production is within limits, but the tenant-level budget tells a different story.
- **No enforcement gap.** Cycles enforces exactly what it's told. If the subject doesn't include a scope level, that level is not checked.

## Severity and impact

Scope misconfiguration is uniquely dangerous because it is **silent**. Unlike a budget exceeded error or a denied reservation, a misconfigured scope produces no errors. Calls succeed, money is spent, and the budget reports look normal — until you realize the per-workspace limits you carefully configured are being bypassed entirely.

**Budget bypass scenario:**

```
Budget setup:
  tenant:acme-corp                    → $100/month
  tenant:acme-corp/workspace:prod     → $50/month

Route A (correct scope):   50 calls × $0.50 = $25 → charged to both tenant and workspace
Route B (missing workspace): 200 calls × $0.50 = $100 → charged to tenant only

Result:
  tenant:acme-corp        → $125 spent (OVER BUDGET)
  workspace:prod           → $25 spent  (looks fine!)
```

The workspace dashboard shows $25 spent — well within the $50 limit. But the tenant is $25 over budget because Route B bypassed workspace-level enforcement entirely. An operator looking at workspace reports sees no problem.

**Cascading misconfiguration.** When one team gets scope construction wrong, other teams sharing the same tenant scope bear the cost. Team A's misconfigured calls drain the tenant budget, causing Team B's correctly-scoped calls to be denied with `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` at the tenant level even though their workspace budget has room.

**Audit failure.** Scope mismatches break cost attribution. If finance needs to know how much the "prod" workspace spent, the answer is incomplete because Route B's spend is invisible at that scope level. This makes chargebacks and cost allocation unreliable.

## Common misconfiguration patterns

### 1. Inconsistent subject fields across routes

Different code paths construct subjects differently. One team uses `workspace`, another doesn't.

**Fix:** Centralize subject construction:

```python
def build_subject(**overrides):
    return {
        "tenant": os.environ["CYCLES_TENANT"],
        "workspace": os.environ.get("CYCLES_WORKSPACE", "default"),
        **overrides,
    }
```

### 2. Missing budget at intermediate scope levels

Budgets exist at `tenant:acme` and `tenant:acme/workspace:prod/app:chatbot`, but not at `tenant:acme/workspace:prod`. Reservations with all three fields check all three scopes. The missing middle scope has no budget, causing `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`.

**Fix:** Create budgets at every scope level that appears in your subject hierarchy:

```bash
# Create budget at every level
curl -s -X POST .../budgets -d '{"scope": "tenant:acme"}'
curl -s -X POST .../budgets -d '{"scope": "tenant:acme/workspace:prod"}'
curl -s -X POST .../budgets -d '{"scope": "tenant:acme/workspace:prod/app:chatbot"}'
```

### 3. Wrong scope order

Cycles scopes follow a fixed hierarchy: `tenant → workspace → app → workflow → agent → toolset`. Providing fields in a different conceptual mapping (e.g., using `agent` for what's really a workspace concept) causes budget checks against the wrong ledgers.

**Fix:** Map your domain concepts to Cycles scopes consistently. See [Scope Derivation](/protocol/how-scope-derivation-works-in-cycles).

### 4. Typos in scope values

`workspace: "prod"` vs `workspace: "production"` creates two separate scope paths with separate budgets. One gets all the traffic, the other sits unused.

**Fix:** Use constants or enums for scope values, not string literals.

### 5. Dynamic scope values from user input

When scope values are derived from user input (API parameters, form fields, URL paths), unsanitized values create unpredictable scope paths:

```python
# DANGEROUS: user-controlled scope value
@cycles(estimate=2000000, action_kind="llm.completion",
        action_name="gpt-4o",
        workspace=request.headers.get("X-Workspace"))
def handle_request(prompt):
    ...
```

If a user sends `X-Workspace: prod/agent:attacker`, the scope path becomes `tenant:acme-corp/workspace:prod/agent:attacker` — a scope that likely has no budget configured, which could cause unexpected `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` errors, or worse, if a permissive fallback budget exists at a parent level, the call may bypass intended limits.

**Fix:** Validate and sanitize scope values against an allowlist:

```python
VALID_WORKSPACES = {"prod", "staging", "dev"}

def safe_workspace(raw_value: str) -> str:
    sanitized = raw_value.strip().lower()
    if sanitized not in VALID_WORKSPACES:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid workspace: {raw_value}")
    return sanitized

@cycles(estimate=2000000, action_kind="llm.completion",
        action_name="gpt-4o",
        workspace=safe_workspace(request.headers.get("X-Workspace", "default")))
def handle_request(prompt):
    ...
```

In TypeScript:

```typescript
const VALID_WORKSPACES = new Set(["prod", "staging", "dev"]);

function safeWorkspace(raw: string | undefined): string {
  const sanitized = (raw ?? "default").trim().toLowerCase();
  if (!VALID_WORKSPACES.has(sanitized)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid workspace: ${raw}`);
  }
  return sanitized;
}
```

## Detection

### Check for scope inconsistency

Compare the scopes that have budget with the scopes appearing in reservation activity:

```bash
# Budget scopes
curl -s "http://localhost:7878/v1/balances?tenant=acme-corp" \
  -H "X-Cycles-API-Key: $API_KEY" | jq '.[].scope'

# Active reservations show which scopes are being used
curl -s "http://localhost:7878/v1/reservations?tenant=acme-corp&status=ACTIVE" \
  -H "X-Cycles-API-Key: $API_KEY" | jq '.[].subject'
```

If reservations are hitting scopes that don't appear in your budget list, you have a configuration gap.

### Use dry-run mode to audit

Run in [shadow mode](/how-to/shadow-mode-in-cycles-how-to-roll-out-budget-enforcement-without-breaking-production) to see all the scopes your application actually uses before creating budgets.

### TypeScript detection example

You can programmatically detect scope gaps by comparing budget scopes against reservation scopes:

```typescript
import { listBalances, listReservations } from "runcycles";

async function detectScopeGaps(tenant: string): Promise<string[]> {
  const balances = await listBalances({ tenant });
  const reservations = await listReservations({ tenant, status: "ACTIVE" });

  const budgetScopes = new Set(balances.map((b) => b.scope));
  const reservationScopes = new Set(reservations.map((r) => r.scope));

  const gaps: string[] = [];
  for (const scope of reservationScopes) {
    if (!budgetScopes.has(scope)) {
      gaps.push(scope);
    }
  }
  return gaps;
}

// Usage
const gaps = await detectScopeGaps("acme-corp");
if (gaps.length > 0) {
  console.warn("Reservations hitting scopes without budgets:", gaps);
}
```

## Monitoring

### Alerting for scope mismatches

```yaml
# Alert when reservations hit scopes that have no configured budget
- alert: CyclesScopeWithoutBudget
  expr: |
    cycles_reservations_created_total{scope=~".+"}
    unless on(scope) cycles_scope_allocated_total
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Reservations hitting scope {{ $labels.scope }} which has no budget"

# Alert when a scope's spend diverges significantly from its child scopes
# (indicates traffic bypassing child scope)
- alert: CyclesScopeSpendMismatch
  expr: |
    cycles_scope_spent_total{level="tenant"}
    - sum(cycles_scope_spent_total{level="workspace"}) by (tenant)
    > 1000000
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Tenant spend exceeds sum of workspace spend — possible scope bypass"

# Alert when a workspace scope shows zero spend while tenant scope is active
- alert: CyclesInactiveChildScope
  expr: |
    cycles_scope_spent_total{level="workspace"} == 0
    and on(tenant) cycles_scope_spent_total{level="tenant"} > 0
  for: 30m
  labels:
    severity: info
  annotations:
    summary: "Workspace {{ $labels.workspace }} has zero spend — check for scope misconfiguration"
```

### Key metrics to track

- **Budget coverage ratio:** scopes with budgets vs distinct scopes in reservations. Should be 1.0.
- **Parent-child spend delta:** difference between parent spend and sum of child spend. Non-zero means traffic is bypassing child scopes.
- **Distinct scope count over time:** sudden increases suggest dynamic scope values from user input (pattern #5).

## Testing scope configuration

### Python: verify all routes include required scope fields

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from runcycles import get_last_reservation

REQUIRED_SCOPE_FIELDS = {"tenant", "workspace"}

def test_route_a_includes_all_scopes():
    """Verify that route_a passes all required scope fields."""
    with patch("myapp.call_llm", return_value="mocked"):
        route_a("test prompt")

    reservation = get_last_reservation()
    subject_keys = set(reservation.subject.keys())
    missing = REQUIRED_SCOPE_FIELDS - subject_keys
    assert not missing, f"Route A missing scope fields: {missing}"

def test_route_b_includes_all_scopes():
    """Verify that route_b passes all required scope fields."""
    with patch("myapp.call_llm", return_value="mocked"):
        route_b("test prompt")

    reservation = get_last_reservation()
    subject_keys = set(reservation.subject.keys())
    missing = REQUIRED_SCOPE_FIELDS - subject_keys
    assert not missing, f"Route B missing scope fields: {missing}"
```

### TypeScript: centralized scope builder with tests

```typescript
import { withCycles } from "runcycles";

// Centralized scope builder — all routes use this
interface ScopeConfig {
  tenant: string;
  workspace: string;
  app?: string;
}

function buildScope(): ScopeConfig {
  const tenant = process.env.CYCLES_TENANT;
  const workspace = process.env.CYCLES_WORKSPACE;
  if (!tenant) throw new Error("CYCLES_TENANT is required");
  if (!workspace) throw new Error("CYCLES_WORKSPACE is required");
  return { tenant, workspace };
}

// Test that buildScope rejects missing fields
describe("buildScope", () => {
  it("throws if CYCLES_TENANT is missing", () => {
    delete process.env.CYCLES_TENANT;
    process.env.CYCLES_WORKSPACE = "prod";
    expect(() => buildScope()).toThrow("CYCLES_TENANT is required");
  });

  it("throws if CYCLES_WORKSPACE is missing", () => {
    process.env.CYCLES_TENANT = "acme-corp";
    delete process.env.CYCLES_WORKSPACE;
    expect(() => buildScope()).toThrow("CYCLES_WORKSPACE is required");
  });

  it("returns all required fields", () => {
    process.env.CYCLES_TENANT = "acme-corp";
    process.env.CYCLES_WORKSPACE = "prod";
    const scope = buildScope();
    expect(scope).toHaveProperty("tenant", "acme-corp");
    expect(scope).toHaveProperty("workspace", "prod");
  });
});
```

## Prevention

1. **Centralize subject construction.** Don't let individual routes build subjects ad hoc.
2. **Use environment variables for common fields.** Tenant, workspace, and app should come from configuration, not hardcoded strings.
3. **Audit scope usage regularly.** Compare active reservation scopes against budget scopes.
4. **Create budgets at all hierarchy levels.** Any scope that appears in a subject needs a budget.
5. **Use shadow mode when adding new scope levels.** Verify the new scopes match before enforcing.

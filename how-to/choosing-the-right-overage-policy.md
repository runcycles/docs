# Choosing the Right Overage Policy

Cycles provides three overage policies that control what happens when actual usage exceeds the reserved estimate. This guide helps you pick the right one based on your use case.

For detailed mechanics and implementation, see [Commit Overage Policies](/protocol/commit-overage-policies-in-cycles-reject-allow-if-available-and-allow-with-overdraft).

## Decision flowchart

Ask these questions in order:

1. **Has the work already happened?** (external import, retroactive accounting, side effect already fired)
   → **ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT** — the ledger must reflect reality

2. **Can you estimate costs reliably?** (fixed-price APIs, known token counts, deterministic operations)
   → **REJECT** with a 10–20% buffer — hard enforcement is safe when estimates are tight

3. **Everything else** — variable-cost LLM calls, tool invocations, streaming responses, multi-step agents
   → **ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE** (the default) — always commits, never creates debt, caps at budget boundary

## By use case

### LLM completions (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)

**Recommended:** ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE

Token counts vary by prompt, context window, and model behavior. Estimation is inherently imprecise. ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE ensures every call is recorded and caps the charge when budget runs low.

```python
@cycles(estimate=50000, action_kind="llm.completion", action_name="openai:gpt-4o")
def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    return openai_client.chat(prompt)
```

### Tool invocations with known costs

**Recommended:** REJECT or ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE

If a tool call has a fixed, predictable cost (e.g., a search API at $0.01/query), REJECT with a buffer works well. If cost varies, use ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE.

```python
# Fixed cost — REJECT is safe
@cycles(estimate=1000, overage_policy="REJECT", action_kind="tool.search", action_name="google-search")
def search(query: str) -> list:
    return search_api.query(query)
```

### External usage imports

**Recommended:** ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT

When importing usage from an external billing system, the work already happened. The budget ledger must reflect it regardless of remaining budget.

```python
# Recording usage from an external gateway
client.create_event(
    subject=Subject(tenant="acme", app="gateway"),
    action=Action(kind="llm.completion", name="external:model"),
    actual=Amount(amount=usage_amount, unit="USD_MICROCENTS"),
    overage_policy="ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT"
)
```

### Multi-step agent workflows

**Recommended:** ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE

Agents that chain multiple LLM calls and tool invocations have highly variable total cost. ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE lets each step commit without risk of rejection, while the budget boundary naturally stops new reservations when funds run out.

### Multi-tenant platforms

**Recommended:** ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE as the tenant default

Set `default_commit_overage_policy: ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE` at the tenant level. This gives tenants a safe default — no debt, no rejected commits — while individual requests can override to REJECT or ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT as needed.

### SLA-critical operations

**Recommended:** ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT

When an operation must succeed regardless of budget state — critical alerts, compliance actions, safety-related tool calls — use ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT so the action is never blocked by budget exhaustion. Set an appropriate `overdraft_limit` and monitor debt.

### Background batch processing

**Recommended:** REJECT

For batch jobs where individual items can be retried, REJECT provides hard budget control. If an item exceeds budget, skip it and retry later when budget is replenished.

## Mixing policies

Most production systems use different policies for different action classes:

| Action class | Policy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| LLM completions | ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE | Variable cost, always record |
| Fixed-cost tools | REJECT | Predictable, retry-safe |
| External imports | ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT | Already happened |
| Agent orchestration | ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE | Variable, multi-step |
| Safety-critical ops | ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT | Must never be blocked |

## Setting the default

The overage policy resolves in this order:

1. **Request-level** `overage_policy` field — per-call override
2. **Tenant default** `default_commit_overage_policy` — set via Admin API
3. **Hardcoded fallback** — `ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE`

For most teams, leaving the default as ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE and overriding per-request for specific action classes is the simplest approach.

## Summary

- **REJECT** — hard stops, best when estimates are reliable, may leave unaccounted gaps
- **ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE** — safe default, always commits, caps at budget, no debt
- **ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT** — ledger accuracy above all, creates debt, requires reconciliation

When in doubt, use ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE. It handles the widest range of scenarios without operational overhead.

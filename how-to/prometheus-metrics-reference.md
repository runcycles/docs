# Prometheus Metrics Reference

This page enumerates every custom metric that Cycles' reference servers expose on their Prometheus endpoints, along with tag definitions, cardinality guidance, and a sample scrape config. For the higher-level observability playbook (alert recipes, SLOs) see [Monitoring and Alerting](/how-to/monitoring-and-alerting).

Cycles' Micrometer instrumentation uses dotted source names (`cycles.*`) which Prometheus rewrites to underscores with a `_total` suffix on scrape. Source names below are the raw Micrometer identifier; the **Prometheus** column is what you actually query and alert on.

::: info Tenant-tag cardinality flag
Every counter tagged with `tenant` respects a shared toggle: `cycles.metrics.tenant-tag.enabled` (env `CYCLES_METRICS_TENANT_TAG_ENABLED`, default `true`) in both `cycles-server` and `cycles-server-events`. Deployments with many thousands of tenants can flip it to `false` to drop the per-tenant series and keep Prometheus cardinality bounded; drop it consistently across services so dashboards can share the same tag schema.

Null or blank tag values are normalised to the sentinel `UNKNOWN`. Missing tags would otherwise collapse series — making it look like traffic moved when the upstream data actually just got sparse.

## Scrape targets

| Service | Scrape port | Prometheus path |
|---|---|---|
| `cycles-server` (runtime) | `7878` (same as API) | `/actuator/prometheus` |
| `cycles-server-events` (dispatcher) | **`9980`** (dedicated management port, split from API `7980` in v0.1.25.9, env `MANAGEMENT_PORT`) | `/actuator/prometheus` |
| `cycles-server-admin` | `7979` (same as API) | `/actuator/prometheus` |

**Events-service port split.** Starting with `cycles-server-events` v0.1.25.9, the `health`, `info`, and `prometheus` actuator endpoints moved from the public API port `7980` to a dedicated management port (default `9980`, env `MANAGEMENT_PORT`). Scrape configs, kubelet probes, and Docker `HEALTHCHECK` commands must target `:9980` — the published Docker image's `HEALTHCHECK` is already updated. Expose `7980` publicly; keep `9980` internal-only.

## Runtime server — `cycles-server`

Introduced in v0.1.25.10. All counters live under the `cycles.*` namespace.

| Source | Prometheus | Type | Tags | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cycles.reservations.reserve` | `cycles_reservations_reserve_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `decision`, `reason`, `overage_policy` | Every `POST /v1/reservations` outcome. |
| `cycles.reservations.commit` | `cycles_reservations_commit_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `decision`, `reason`, `overage_policy` | Every `POST /v1/reservations/{id}/commit` outcome. |
| `cycles.reservations.release` | `cycles_reservations_release_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `actor_type`, `decision`, `reason` | Every successful release. `actor_type` distinguishes tenant-driven releases from v0.1.25.8 admin-on-behalf-of releases. |
| `cycles.reservations.extend` | `cycles_reservations_extend_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `decision`, `reason` | Every `POST /v1/reservations/{id}/extend` outcome. |
| `cycles.reservations.expired` | `cycles_reservations_expired_total` | Counter | `tenant` | Each reservation the expiry sweep actually marks EXPIRED. Skipped reservations (still in grace, already finalised) do not increment. |
| `cycles.events` | `cycles_events_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `decision`, `reason`, `overage_policy` | Every `POST /v1/events` outcome. |
| `cycles.overdraft.incurred` | `cycles_overdraft_incurred_total` | Counter | `tenant` | Any commit or event that actually accrued non-zero debt. Unit-free signal — debt amount is tracked by the balance store, not here, to avoid leaking user-value distributions into metrics. |

### Tag value reference (runtime)

| Tag | Values |
|---|---|
| `decision` | `ALLOW`, `ALLOW_WITH_CAPS`, `DENY`, `EXPIRED`, `RELEASED`, `COMMITTED`, `EXTENDED` — the outcome of the decision machinery. |
| `reason` | Spec-defined reason codes (`INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, `OVER_LIMIT`, `POLICY_DENIED`, etc.). `UNKNOWN` when the code path doesn't produce one. |
| `overage_policy` | `BLOCK`, `ALLOW_WITH_DEBT`, `ALLOW_WITH_CAP` — which policy was in effect for the scope. |
| `actor_type` | `api_key` (tenant-driven) or `admin_on_behalf_of` (admin-driven, v0.1.25.8+). |

### Not instrumented (by design)

- **HTTP-layer latency histograms** — Spring Boot auto-emits `http.server.requests` with `uri` / `method` / `status` labels already. Use those for per-endpoint latency.
- **Lua-script execution time** — `EVALSHA` timings would largely duplicate the HTTP timer for request-synchronous scripts. The expiry-sweep counter (`cycles.reservations.expired`) covers the one non-request-driven path.

## Events service — `cycles-server-events`

Introduced in v0.1.25.6. Mirrors the runtime's conventions: `cycles.webhook.*` rewrites to `cycles_webhook_*_total` (counters) or `cycles_webhook_*_seconds` (timer). Unlike the runtime, this service emits an explicit latency timer because it's the HTTP *client* — Spring's auto `http.server.requests` doesn't cover its primary I/O surface.

| Source | Prometheus | Type | Tags | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cycles.webhook.delivery.attempts` | `cycles_webhook_delivery_attempts_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `event_type` | Every outbound delivery attempt (first attempt + every retry). |
| `cycles.webhook.delivery.success` | `cycles_webhook_delivery_success_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `event_type`, `status_code_family` | Successful deliveries. `status_code_family`: `2xx`. |
| `cycles.webhook.delivery.failed` | `cycles_webhook_delivery_failed_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `event_type`, `reason` | Failed deliveries. `reason` carries the transport-level code (`timeout`, `connection_refused`, `4xx`, `5xx`, etc.). |
| `cycles.webhook.delivery.retried` | `cycles_webhook_delivery_retried_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `event_type` | Deliveries that re-entered the retry queue. |
| `cycles.webhook.delivery.stale` | `cycles_webhook_delivery_stale_total` | Counter | `tenant` | Deliveries auto-failed on pickup for exceeding `dispatch.max-delivery-age-ms` (default 24h). |
| `cycles.webhook.subscription.auto_disabled` | `cycles_webhook_subscription_auto_disabled_total` | Counter | `tenant`, `reason` | Subscriptions auto-disabled after consecutive failures crossed the threshold. Reason is typically `consecutive_failures_exceeded_threshold`. Always emitted together with a `webhook.disabled` Event (v0.1.25.11). |
| `cycles.webhook.delivery.latency` | `cycles_webhook_delivery_latency_seconds` | Timer | `tenant`, `event_type`, `outcome` | Round-trip time on deliveries that actually produced a transport response. `outcome`: `success` or `failure`. Upstream failures (event_not_found, etc.) have no meaningful latency and do not record to this timer. |
| `cycles.webhook.events.payload.invalid` | `cycles_webhook_events_payload_invalid_total` | Counter | `type`, `rule` | Non-fatal shape discrepancy found by `EventPayloadValidator` on an ingested event. No tenant dimension — the discrepancy is about payload shape, not tenant traffic. `rule` examples: `trace_id_shape`, `correlation_id_shape`, `timestamp_shape`. |

### Tag value reference (events)

| Tag | Values |
|---|---|
| `event_type` | Event kind from the [Event Payloads Reference](/protocol/event-payloads-reference) (e.g. `reservation.reserved`, `budget.over_limit`, `webhook.disabled`). Up to ~51 distinct values. |
| `status_code_family` | `2xx` (success bucket). Non-2xx responses land on `cycles_webhook_delivery_failed_total` with `reason` instead. |
| `reason` (on `_failed_total`) | `timeout`, `connection_refused`, `connection_reset`, `ssl_error`, `4xx`, `5xx`, `event_not_found`, `signing_key_unavailable`. |

## Admin server — `cycles-server-admin`

Exposed since admin observability rollout (v0.1.25.9+). Metric names use the `cycles_admin_*` prefix.

| Prometheus | Type | Tags | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cycles_admin_audit_writes_total` | Counter | `path_class`, `outcome` | Audit-trail write accounting. `outcome` values: `written`, `error` (Redis write failed — alert on nonzero), `sampled-out` (pre-auth sampling dropped the entry per `audit.sample.unauthenticated`). `path_class` groups endpoints for coarse-grained triage. Shipped v0.1.25.20 alongside the audit-on-failure coverage. |
| `cycles_admin_events_emitted_total` | Counter | `type`, `result` | Admin-emitted Event accounting. `result`: `success` or `failure`. |
| `cycles_admin_events_payload_invalid_total` | Counter | `type`, `expected_class` | Jackson round-trip found an Event payload that didn't match its declared schema. Non-fatal — admin continues to accept the event. |
| `cycles_admin_webhook_dispatched_total` | Counter | `result` | Enqueue-to-dispatcher accounting. The end-to-end delivery metric is `cycles_webhook_delivery_*` on the events service. |

## Sample scrape config

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: cycles-runtime
    metrics_path: /actuator/prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['cycles-server:7878']

  - job_name: cycles-events
    metrics_path: /actuator/prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['cycles-server-events:9980']  # management port, NOT the API port (7980)

  - job_name: cycles-admin
    metrics_path: /actuator/prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['cycles-server-admin:7979']
```

## Cardinality guidance

The `tenant` tag is the dominant cardinality driver. A deployment with 10,000 tenants and all seven runtime counters produces ~70,000 time series just from the tenant dimension. If Prometheus memory / scrape duration becomes a concern:

1. **Flip `cycles.metrics.tenant-tag.enabled` to `false`** on runtime and events. Counters drop the `tenant` tag; you lose per-tenant drill-downs but keep decision / reason / outcome signals.
2. **Aggregate at scrape time** with `metric_relabel_configs` to drop the tag selectively on high-cardinality metrics while keeping it on the ones you still want tenant-sliced.
3. **Keep per-tenant on Timer, drop on Counters** if delivery-latency-per-tenant is the signal you care about most.

`event_type` is bounded by the spec (51 values today, additive over time). `reason` and `decision` are enum-bounded and safe.

## Quick alert recipes

| Signal | Query | Typical threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Audit-write error | `sum(rate(cycles_admin_audit_writes_total{outcome="error"}[5m])) > 0` | Any nonzero — audit trail has a gap. |
| Webhook auto-disable rate | `sum(rate(cycles_webhook_subscription_auto_disabled_total[15m])) > 0` | Any nonzero — a subscription was just auto-disabled. |
| Overdraft rate spike | `sum(rate(cycles_overdraft_incurred_total[5m])) / sum(rate(cycles_reservations_commit_total[5m])) > 0.05` | Over 5% of commits are going into overdraft. |
| Dispatch p95 latency | `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(cycles_webhook_delivery_latency_seconds_bucket{outcome="success"}[5m])) by (le))` | Over 10s — something downstream is struggling. |
| Stale-delivery rate | `sum(rate(cycles_webhook_delivery_stale_total[1h])) > 0` | Any nonzero — deliveries are sitting in-queue past `dispatch.max-delivery-age-ms`. |

# Integration Ecosystem

Cycles integrates with the tools, frameworks, and AI providers you already use. Whether you're building autonomous agents, adding runtime authority to an existing application, or exploring what's possible with controlled AI spending, there's an integration path for you.

## AI Model Providers

### OpenAI

Integrate Cycles runtime authority with ChatGPT, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and other OpenAI models. Control per-request and per-session spending when your agents call OpenAI APIs.

### Anthropic

Use Cycles with Claude models to set spending limits on autonomous agent workflows powered by Anthropic's API. Available in both Python and TypeScript.

### Google Gemini

Add runtime authority to applications built on Google's Gemini family of models.

## AI Frameworks & SDKs

### LangChain (Python)

Build budget-aware LangChain agents in Python. Cycles integrates with LangChain's tool and callback system to enforce spending limits throughout chain execution.

The Cycles Protocol is an open specification for runtime authority in autonomous agent systems, licensed under Apache 2.0. Build your own implementation or contribute to the spec.

- [Cycles Protocol on GitHub](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-protocol)

### OpenAPI Specification

A complete OpenAPI specification is available for the Cycles API, making it straightforward to generate clients in any language or integrate with API tooling.

## Community Tools

The Cycles ecosystem grows with every project that adopts runtime authority. If you've built a library, plugin, tool, or integration that works with Cycles, we want to hear about it.

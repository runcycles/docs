# Using the Cycles Dashboard

The [Cycles Admin Dashboard](/quickstart/deploying-the-cycles-dashboard) is a Vue 3 SPA that sits in front of `cycles-server-admin` and `cycles-server`. Everything it does is a call against those two backends — the dashboard itself holds no state. This page is the operator's tour: how to log in, what every page does, and which features are behind which admin key capability.

If you haven't deployed the dashboard yet, start with [Deploy the Cycles Admin Dashboard](/quickstart/deploying-the-cycles-dashboard). The examples below assume the dashboard is reachable at `https://admin.example.com`.

## Login and capability gating

The only credential the dashboard accepts is an admin API key. On the login page:

1. Enter the admin API key (the value of `ADMIN_API_KEY` on the server).
2. The dashboard calls `GET /v1/auth/introspect` to validate the key and retrieve the capability set.
3. Sidebar navigation, action buttons, and page access are all gated by capability booleans returned by introspect (`view_overview`, `view_budgets`, `edit_budgets`, `force_release_reservations`, etc.).

The key is stored in `sessionStorage` — it survives a page refresh but is cleared when the tab closes. It is never written to `localStorage` or a cookie. Idle timeout is 30 minutes; absolute timeout is 8 hours; the check runs every 15 seconds.

After 3 failed login attempts the dashboard enforces exponential backoff (5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 60s cap). A 401 or 403 from any subsequent API call clears the session and redirects to login.

::: tip Treat the admin key like a root credential
There is no user login, no SSO out of the box. Rotate the key regularly, keep it in a secrets manager, and consider putting the dashboard behind SSO or VPN. The dashboard does not weaken this — it uses whatever key you give it.

## The ten views

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Overview | Single-request aggregated health — counter strip, four donut charts (budget status / utilization / events by category / webhook fleet), and attention cards for actionable work. See [Overview screen](#overview-screen). |
| Tenants | Tenant list and detail, with nested Budgets / API Keys / Policies tabs |
| Tenant detail (`/tenants/:id`) | Per-tenant drill-down with hierarchy breadcrumbs (`tenant → workspace → app`) |
| Budgets | Tenant-scoped budget list with utilization and debt bars; inline `RESET` and `RESET_SPENT` |
| Events | Correlation-first investigation tool with expandable detail rows |
| API Keys (`/api-keys`) | Cross-tenant key list with masked IDs, permissions, status filters |
| Webhooks | Subscription health (green / yellow / red) plus delivery history, replay, and test |
| Webhook detail (`/webhooks/:id`) | Four-stat row (last-success chip, delivery-outcome donut, attempts histogram, response-time p50/p95/max — see [WebhookDetailView stats row](#webhookdetailview-stats-row-v0-1-25-51)), delivery timeline, last error, signature rotation, pause/resume |
| Reservations (`/reservations`) | Hung-reservation force-release during incident response (runtime-plane admin-on-behalf-of) |
| Audit | Compliance query tool with CSV / JSON export |

Most pages poll their backends on a page-specific interval — see the [deployment guide](/quickstart/deploying-the-cycles-dashboard#polling-cadence) for the cadence table. Audit is manual-only: you press **Run Query** explicitly to avoid drive-by queries against retention-expensive endpoints.

## Overview screen

The Overview is the landing page. It opens on a single `/v1/admin/overview` fetch that hydrates the counter strip, four attention cards, and the four donut charts.

### Counter strip

Top of page. Six tiles — Tenants, Budgets, API Keys, Webhooks, Reservations, Events (60m window) — each with a click target that drills to the corresponding list view with any relevant filter pre-applied. Counter totals are server-aggregated via `AdminOverviewService`, so they reconcile by construction with the list pages' own counts (no client-side reduce drift).

### The four donuts (v0.1.25.47–.52)

Beneath the counter strip sits a 4-up donut grid. Every slice is clickable and drills to the corresponding filtered list view — chart and list read from the same server aggregate so the numbers match.

| Donut | Slices | Slice-click target |
|---|---|---|
| Budget status | Active / Frozen / Over-limit / Closed | `/budgets?status=ACTIVE\|FROZEN\|CLOSED` or `/budgets?filter=over_limit` |
| Budget utilization | Healthy (<90%) / Near cap (90–99%) / Over cap (≥100%) | `/budgets?utilization_min=…&utilization_max=…` (integer percent, v0.1.25.50) |
| Events by category | `budget` / `reservation` / `tenant` / `api_key` / `policy` / `webhook` / `system` / `runtime` | `/events?category=<name>&from=<window-start>&to=<now>` — time window mirrors the counter-strip "Events (Xm)" window (v0.1.25.53) |
| Webhook fleet health | Active / Paused / Disabled | `/webhooks?status=ACTIVE\|PAUSED\|DISABLED` |

Each card title carries a muted "· click a slice" hint to telegraph interactivity. Dark-mode palette re-derives on toggle (the charts aren't just re-skinned images — they're vue-echarts instances driven by a reactive `useChartTheme` composable). Spec-terminal CLOSED budgets are filtered out of the utilization bucketing and total (v0.1.25.59) so a CLOSED budget at 120% doesn't inflate "Over cap" and CLOSED budgets don't inflate "Healthy" — FROZEN stays included because it's non-terminal. Independently, the five attention cards exclude rows owned by CLOSED tenants (v0.1.25.45) so the transient Mode-B cascade window doesn't surface un-actionable work. Screen readers get an auto-rendered `sr-only` data table per pie chart (v0.1.25.56).

Under the donuts, five attention cards surface actionable work: Budgets at or near cap, Frozen budgets, Budgets with debt, Expiring API keys, Failing webhooks. Each card's "View all" link carries the same filter the card applied, so drill-down and card count agree by construction.

## Power-user features

### Command palette — `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`

Press `Cmd+K` on macOS or `Ctrl+K` on Linux/Windows to open the palette. It searches tenants, budgets, webhooks, API keys, and reservations by ID or name, and exposes common incident actions (freeze budget, suspend tenant, revoke API key, pause webhook) without navigation. The palette respects capability gating — actions you cannot perform do not appear.

### Bulk action lanes

The Tenants, Webhooks, and Budgets pages expose a filter-then-bulk workflow:

1. Apply filters in the page toolbar (`status`, `plan`, `over_limit`, etc.) until the row count is what you want to act on.
2. Click **Bulk action**. A side panel opens with the `expected_count` pre-filled from the current filter.
3. Pick the action. Tenants: `SUSPEND`, `REACTIVATE`, `CLOSE`. Webhooks: `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `DELETE`. Budgets (v0.1.25.35+, requires admin v0.1.25.29+): `CREDIT`, `DEBIT`, `RESET`, `RESET_SPENT`, `REPAY_DEBT`. A blast-radius summary confirms before execution.
4. The dashboard calls `POST /v1/admin/tenants/bulk-action`, `/v1/admin/webhooks/bulk-action`, or `/v1/admin/budgets/bulk-action` with the filter, the `expected_count` safety gate, and an idempotency key generated from the current session.
5. The result panel shows per-row `succeeded`, `failed`, `skipped` lists — rendered in a `BulkActionResultDialog` (v0.1.25.34+) with per-row copy-ID affordances and operator-friendly error messages sourced from the shared `errorCodeMessages` catalog. Failed rows show the per-row `error_code`.

**Row-select variant (v0.1.25.36).** The Budgets view also supports row-select bulk Freeze and Unfreeze — select individual checkboxes across filtered rows rather than applying to the whole filter. Row-select bulk failures open the same `BulkActionResultDialog` with per-row status.

See [Using Bulk Actions](/how-to/using-bulk-actions-for-tenants-and-webhooks) for the full request shape and error taxonomy.

### Cross-surface correlation chip (v0.1.25.39)

Every row on Events, Audit, and WebhookDeliveries views carries a **correlation chip** with three identifiers — `trace_id`, `request_id`, `correlation_id` (see [Correlation and Tracing](/protocol/correlation-and-tracing-in-cycles) for what each one scopes). Clicking any identifier opens a pivot menu:

- Click `trace_id` on an Audit row → EventsView filtered to the same trace, plus a side panel with every webhook delivery dispatched under that trace.
- Click `trace_id` on an Events row → AuditView filtered to the originating entry.
- Click `correlation_id` on an EventTimeline row → EventsView filtered to all events in the same cluster (v0.1.25.37+).
- Copy-to-clipboard icon on the chip for sharing into tickets or chat.

This is how operator triage starts in v0.1.25: pull a `trace_id` out of a failing response header (`X-Cycles-Trace-Id`) or error body, paste into the dashboard command palette, and follow the chip through the four views. Requires `cycles-server-admin` v0.1.25.31+ for server-side support. See [Correlation and Tracing](/protocol/correlation-and-tracing-in-cycles).

### Terminal-state row toggle (v0.1.25.46)

Default sort on every list view is `created_at desc`, which pins recently-transitioned terminal rows to the top — closed tenants, disabled webhooks, revoked / expired API keys, closed budgets. Before v0.1.25.46 these dominated the first screen and operators had to add an explicit status filter to get them out of the way.

Tenants, Budgets, Webhooks, and API Keys now hide terminal rows by default and surface a "Show closed (N)" / "Show disabled (N)" / "Show revoked (N)" toggle with the hidden count. Flipping the toggle partitions the list so active rows stay on top and terminal rows drop to the bottom — column-sort order is preserved within each group. Matches the GitHub / Linear / Gmail convention for done / archived items.

| View | Terminal definition |
|---|---|
| Tenants | `status=CLOSED` |
| Budgets | `status=CLOSED` (FROZEN stays visible — it's non-terminal) |
| Webhooks | `status=DISABLED` |
| API Keys | `status IN (REVOKED, EXPIRED)` |

Toggle state mirrors to URL as `?include_terminal=1` on top-level views so deep-links survive across reloads. Picking a terminal status explicitly from the dropdown (e.g. `status=CLOSED`) auto-engages the toggle so the list isn't silently empty. Tenant-detail sub-tabs (Budgets / API Keys / Policies) default off and don't mirror to URL (they share a URL with the parent).

### WebhookDetailView stats row (v0.1.25.51)

Clicking a webhook subscription opens `/webhooks/:id`. Between the subscription card and the Delivery History table sits a four-up stat row that aggregates over recently-loaded deliveries:

| Stat | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Last success | Chip with traffic-light semantics — green if < 1h, amber 1h–24h, red ≥ 24h or no successful delivery on file. The fastest visual check that a subscription is still delivering. |
| Delivery outcome | Donut partitioning loaded deliveries by status (success / retrying / failed / stale). Clicking a slice sets the delivery-table status filter in place — no route change, because the filter is local. |
| Attempts per delivery | Histogram bucketed 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5+ with a severity color ramp. Makes retry storms visible before you scan rows. |
| Response time | p50 / p95 / max computed via NIST nearest-rank over deliveries that carry `response_time_ms`. |

The stats aggregate whatever deliveries the history table has loaded — there's no second fetch. Scroll / Load More on the table re-computes the stats in place.

### Freshness pill on page headers (v0.1.25.54)

Polling list views show a small muted "Updated Xm ago" pill on the `PageHeader`, beside the refresh button. It reads `usePolling.lastSuccessAt` — successful polls update it; failed polls leave it alone, so operators can tell at a glance whether they're looking at fresh data or a silent poll outage. Absent on manual-query pages (Audit) and on views that don't poll.

### Tenant hierarchy breadcrumbs

Tenant detail pages show the full scope hierarchy — `tenant → workspace → app → workflow` — as a breadcrumb trail. Clicking any segment navigates up the scope path without losing context (filters, tab selection, and expanded rows are preserved).

### RESET_SPENT inline funding

On the Budgets page, every row has a funding dropdown. Alongside `CREDIT`, `DEBIT`, `REPAY_DEBT`, and `RESET`, the dropdown exposes `RESET_SPENT` — the v0.1.25.18+ funding operation that clears `spent` without touching `allocated`, `reserved`, or `debt`. Picking it opens a confirmation dialog where you can either leave the new `spent` value at zero (monthly rollover) or enter an explicit starting value (prorated correction).

See [Rolling Over Billing Periods with RESET_SPENT](/how-to/rolling-over-billing-periods-with-reset-spent) for when to use each pattern.

### Closed-tenant tombstone and cascade preview

As of v0.1.25.43 (consuming admin v0.1.25.36), the dashboard surfaces tenant-close cascade behavior through four coordinated affordances:

- **Closed-tenant banner.** When `tenant.status === 'CLOSED'`, an amber read-only banner renders at the top of `TenantDetailView`: *"Tenant closed — all owned objects are read-only."* Immediately answers the "why won't this unfreeze?" question on closed-tenant pages.
- **CLOSE confirm-dialog cascade preview.** Before closing, the confirmation dialog enumerates what will be terminated — owned budgets, webhook subscriptions, API keys, open reservations, with counts pulled from already-loaded tenant-detail state. Spells out *"This cannot be undone."* Useful for estimating blast radius before pulling the trigger.
- **`TENANT_CLOSED` 409 humanizer.** Any mutation that races the cascade (stale tab, deep-link, in-flight request) surfaces as *"Tenant is closed — this object is read-only."* instead of a raw 409. Lives alongside the existing error-code map in `errorCodeMessages.ts`.
- **Tenant-cascade audit + event chip.** `AuditView` and `EventTimeline` rows render a small amber "tenant cascade" chip when the event carries a `_via_tenant_cascade` suffix (`budget.closed_via_tenant_cascade`, `webhook.disabled_via_tenant_cascade`, `api_key.revoked_via_tenant_cascade`, `reservation.released_via_tenant_cascade`, or audit operation `tenant_close_cascade`). Lets operators visually distinguish cascade-triggered state changes from user-driven ones when correlating by `correlation_id`.

Requires admin v0.1.25.36. Running the dashboard against admin `.32` still renders the tombstone + dialog preview (pure client-side), but the cascade itself won't fire and frozen budgets on closed tenants continue to inflate the Overview alert counter. Running against `.35` works for the common cascade path (budgets + reservations are cascaded and their mutations return `TENANT_CLOSED`), but policy / api-key / webhook-admin mutations against closed-tenant objects still go through without the Rule 2 guard — `.36` closes those remaining endpoints.

See [Tenant-Close Cascade Semantics](/protocol/tenant-close-cascade-semantics) for the full protocol contract.

## Incident-response actions

Every destructive action is one-click with a confirmation and a blast-radius summary:

| Action | Page | Backend call |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Freeze budget | Budgets / Budget detail | `PATCH /v1/admin/budgets?status=FROZEN` |
| Unfreeze budget | Budgets | `PATCH /v1/admin/budgets?status=ACTIVE` |
| Bulk Freeze / Unfreeze budgets (v0.1.25.36+) | Budgets — row-select + floating toolbar | `POST /v1/admin/budgets/bulk-action` |
| Suspend tenant | Tenants / Tenant detail | `PATCH /v1/admin/tenants/{id}` |
| Reactivate tenant | Tenants | `PATCH /v1/admin/tenants/{id}` |
| Revoke API key | API Keys | `DELETE /v1/admin/api-keys/{id}` |
| Pause webhook | Webhooks / Webhook detail | `PATCH /v1/admin/webhooks/{id}` |
| Resume webhook | Webhooks | `PATCH /v1/admin/webhooks/{id}` |
| Test webhook | Webhook detail | `POST /v1/admin/webhooks/{id}/test` |
| Replay webhook delivery | Webhook detail | `POST /v1/admin/webhook-deliveries/{id}/replay` |
| Force-release reservation | Reservations / Reservation detail | `POST /v1/reservations/{id}/release` with `X-Admin-API-Key` |
| Emergency tenant-wide freeze | Tenant detail | Bulk freeze across all budgets for the tenant |
| Close tenant (cascades owned objects, v0.1.25.43+) | Tenants / Tenant detail | `PATCH /v1/admin/tenants/{id}` — dashboard shows cascade preview before confirming |

Force-release uses dual authentication — the dashboard's nginx routes `/v1/reservations*` to `cycles-server:7878` and the runtime server validates both keys before executing. The audit log tags the action `actor_type=admin_on_behalf_of`. See [Force-Releasing Stuck Reservations](/how-to/force-releasing-stuck-reservations-as-an-operator) for the underlying flow.

## Events investigation

The Events page is correlation-first, not time-first:

- Every row has a `correlation_id` (request-scoped) and `request_id` (hop-scoped). Clicking either filters to the full graph of related events across budgets, reservations, webhooks, and audit.
- Expandable detail rows show the full event payload — including `data`, `actor`, `metadata`, and delivery outcome if the event went out over a webhook.
- Filters: event type, category, tenant, scope, time range, correlation ID.

Events poll every 15 seconds (the most aggressive of any page) because incident response typically starts here.

Per-row **Copy JSON** (v0.1.25.37+) is available on every surface rendering an event, audit entry, event-timeline entry, or webhook delivery — part of the shared triage affordances extracted to the icon library in v0.1.25.40. The correlation chip (trace_id / request_id / correlation_id) is available on the same rows.

## Audit page

Audit is the one page that is manual-only. You build a query, press **Run Query**, and the dashboard calls `GET /v1/admin/audit/logs` with the filter you built.

Supported filters (v0.1.25.33 UI + v0.1.25.27 server DSL): `tenant_id`, `actor_type`, `action_kind`, `idempotency_key`, `bulk_idempotency_key`, `request_id`, `trace_id`, `error_code` (IN-list), `error_code_exclude` (NOT-IN-list), `status_min` / `status_max` (range), `operation` (IN-list), `resource_type` (typeahead + IN-list), free-text `search`, time range. Deep-link URL params (`?error_code_exclude=`, `?status_min=`) support sharable filter state. Results can be exported as CSV or JSON for compliance review.

Bulk-action audit rows expand into a structured detail panel (v0.1.25.38) that renders `succeeded_ids`, `failed_rows`, `skipped_rows`, `filter` echo, and `duration_ms` as a first-class layout instead of raw JSON — per-row copy affordances are wired for immediate triage.

Failed-request entries (added in `cycles-server-admin` v0.1.25.20) are included in results. In v0.1.25.28+ servers, their `tenant_id` is `__unauth__` (pre-auth failures) or `__admin__` (admin-plane ops); pre-.28 rows continue to show the historical `<unauthenticated>` literal. All three are queryable from the Audit filter dropdown. Tiered retention — authenticated entries live 400 days by default, unauthenticated entries 30 days.

## Monitoring the dashboard itself

The dashboard is a static SPA and has no backend of its own, so its "health" is effectively the health of `cycles-server-admin`. Two good synthetic monitoring targets:

- `GET /v1/admin/overview` — if it returns 200, the full stack (Redis + admin + auth) is working.
- `GET /actuator/health` on the admin server — standard Spring Boot liveness.

Alert on the overview payload's `failing_webhooks` and `over_limit_scopes` arrays.

## Mobile layout (v0.1.25.58)

The dashboard is admin-console density, not phone-native, but v0.1.25.58 landed a mobile-responsive sweep covering the paths operators actually take from a phone during incident response:

- Shell: Escape closes the drawer with focus-return to the hamburger; hamburger is sized 44×44 with `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`; root uses `h-dvh` so mobile Safari's collapsing URL bar doesn't cut off content.
- Layout: `PageHeader` reflows to a column on narrow viewports; `LoginView` and `NotFoundView` fit 320-wide screens.
- Menus and dialogs: `RowActionsMenu` clamps horizontally to the viewport; `FormDialog` and `ConfirmAction` footers flex-wrap so buttons don't clip.
- Tables: minimum widths tightened (AuditView 1000 → 900 px), with horizontal scroll as the fallback when rows don't fit.

**Known deferrals.** Virtualized list tables still use horizontal scroll on phones rather than a card layout; the command palette's soft-keyboard viewport handling is not wired to `visualViewport`; the bulk-action preview / result dialog tables overflow on narrow viewports; the `TimeRangePicker` popover can overflow horizontally. None block incident triage — they're follow-ups for a dedicated mobile pass.

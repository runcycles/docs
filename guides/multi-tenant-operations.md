# Multi-Tenant AI Agent Operations: A Production Reference

A reference map of running multi-tenant AI agent infrastructure in production. Cost calculators answer *how much* an agent will spend; blast-radius calculators answer *what damage* it can cause; this guide answers the third question: **who owns which budget, who gets which actions, and how do those boundaries hold up when tenants share infrastructure?**

> **Multi-tenant operations is one of the four production pillars of runtime authority.** Cost controls what agents *spend*. Action authority controls what agents *do*. Tenant isolation controls *who owns the boundary*. Audit evidence proves *what happened*. For the full product framing, see [Why Cycles](/why-cycles).

| Guide | The question it answers |
|---|---|
| [LLM Cost Runtime Control](/guides/llm-cost-runtime-control) | What can this agent spend? |
| [Risk & Blast Radius](/guides/risk-and-blast-radius) | What can this agent do? |
| **Multi-Tenant AI Agent Operations** (this guide) | Whose budget, scope, and audit trail does this action belong to? |

> **Quantify your noisy-tenant exposure:** [Cost Calculator →](/calculators/claude-vs-gpt-cost-standalone) — pre-loaded multi-tenant scenarios show what one tenant running 50× the average load costs the rest of the cluster.

If you are debugging a live tenant-leak or noisy-neighbor incident, jump straight to [Scope misconfiguration and budget leaks](/incidents/scope-misconfiguration-and-budget-leaks).

## Why multi-tenancy is the dominant production-failure pattern

Most production AI workloads are multi-tenant in some form — SaaS customers, internal teams, environment splits, agent classes. The dominant cost-failure mode in these systems is not "the workload spent too much" — it is "*one tenant* drove the spend that everyone else paid for." Provider-level controls cannot detect or prevent this; they enforce at the org level, not the tenant level.

- [Multi-Tenant AI Cost Control: Budgets and Isolation](/blog/multi-tenant-ai-cost-control-per-tenant-budgets-quotas-isolation) — the noisy-neighbor pattern, with code
- [Agents Are Cross-Cutting. Your Controls Aren't.](/blog/agents-are-cross-cutting-your-controls-arent) — why per-service auth does not bound a multi-service agent

## Scope hierarchy: the unit of isolation

Multi-tenant authority is a tree, not a flat list. Cycles' canonical scope hierarchy is `tenant → workspace → app → workflow → agent → toolset`. Budget and policy decisions cascade up the hierarchy — a workflow cap is bounded by the workspace cap, which is bounded by the tenant cap. Operators only need to create budgets at the levels they actually use; intermediate levels without budgets are skipped during enforcement.

- [Authentication, tenancy, and API keys](/protocol/authentication-tenancy-and-api-keys-in-cycles) — how identity flows into scope

## Per-tenant budget enforcement

The moment a single shared budget is split into per-tenant budgets, the noisy-neighbor problem stops being a cost-control problem and becomes a tenant-isolation problem. Each tenant gets its own budget boundary; one tenant's runaway cannot drain another tenant's headroom — when requests are scoped correctly. Scope correctness is a precondition; see [scope misconfiguration and budget leaks](/incidents/scope-misconfiguration-and-budget-leaks) for what goes wrong when it isn't.

- [Tenant creation and management](/how-to/tenant-creation-and-management-in-cycles)

## Multi-agent coordination

When multiple agents serve the same tenant — or worse, when a single agent serves multiple tenants — naive budget checks race. Ten agents seeing the same available headroom and all proceeding is the canonical TOCTOU pattern at the cost layer.

## Tenant lifecycle: create, isolate, close

Onboarding a tenant is the easy part. The hard parts are: ensuring isolation under concurrent traffic, handling tenant suspension or close cleanly so in-flight reservations don't leak, and cascading cleanup when a tenant churns.

- [Tenant-close cascade semantics](/protocol/tenant-close-cascade-semantics) — protocol detail
- [Bulk actions for tenants and webhooks](/how-to/using-bulk-actions-for-tenants-and-webhooks)

## Identity, keys, and least privilege

Every tenant action ultimately resolves to a credential at the call site. Authority bounds what a tenant's agent is *allowed to attempt*; least-privilege keys bound what the underlying API will let it do *if* it tries. They are complementary layers — neither alone is sufficient.

- [API key management in Cycles](/how-to/api-key-management-in-cycles)

## Cross-platform tenancy

Most enterprise customers do not have a single AI agent surface. They have agents inside Salesforce, agents inside ServiceNow, agents in their own product, and internal agents on Slack. Each platform governs its own agents — but no single platform governs the *system*.

- [Cross-Platform AI Agent Governance: Runtime Enforcement Across Vendors](/blog/ai-agent-governance-runtime-enforcement-security-cost-compliance)

## Failure modes specific to multi-tenancy

Multi-tenant systems have failure modes single-tenant systems do not — scope misconfiguration, key reuse across environments, leaked tenant identifiers, cascade ordering bugs. Most are not detectable in single-tenant testing.

- [Retry storms and idempotency failures](/incidents/retry-storms-and-idempotency-failures) — amplifies fast in multi-tenant settings

## Audit trail by tenant

Per-tenant ledgers create per-tenant audit trails as a side effect. Every allow/deny, every reservation, every commit, every degraded action — attributable to the tenant that drove it. That audit is the substrate for compliance, billing reconciliation, and post-incident review.

- [Operational Runbook: Using Cycles Runtime Events](/blog/operational-runbook-using-cycles-runtime-events)

## Production operations per tenant

Once enforcement is per-tenant, operations follow: per-tenant dashboards, per-tenant alerts, per-tenant rollover of billing periods, per-tenant degradation policies. The shape of the operations problem changes when tenancy is a first-class boundary.

- [Production operations guide](/how-to/production-operations-guide)

## Rolling out tenant boundaries to an existing single-tenant system

The riskiest deployment of all is adding tenant boundaries to a system that does not have them. Shadow mode lets you observe what tenant-scoped enforcement *would* do without breaking anything in production, calibrate per-tenant budgets against real traffic, and cut over tenant by tenant.

## The complement guides

This guide focuses on **who** owns which budget. For **what they spend**, see [LLM Cost Runtime Control Reference](/guides/llm-cost-runtime-control). For **what they're allowed to do**, see [AI Agent Risk & Blast Radius Reference](/guides/risk-and-blast-radius). Most production incidents in multi-tenant AI touch all three.

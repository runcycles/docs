# The State of AI Agent Incidents (2026): Failures, Costs, and What Would Have Prevented Them

AI agents are shipping to production faster than the infrastructure to control them. The result is a growing catalogue of incidents — runaway costs, wrong actions, security exploits, and cascading multi-agent failures — that share a common root cause: **no pre-execution enforcement**.

This report catalogues documented incidents and recurring failure patterns, scores each by cost and blast radius, and maps them to the runtime controls that would have prevented them.

<!-- more -->

## Key findings

- **20+ documented incidents and recurring patterns** across cost, action, security, and multi-agent categories
- **Costs in this report range from $1.40 to $12,400 per incident** in direct model spend (documented and pattern-based), with business impact reaching $50,000+ from a single $1.40 agent run
- **Some of the most damaging incidents cost very little in tokens.** A $1.40 model run caused [$50K+ in pipeline damage](/blog/ai-agent-action-control-hard-limits-side-effects). A $0.80 run triggered an [unauthorized purchase](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/31/openai_operator_agent/). A $2.00 run [deleted a production database](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/after-nine-years-of-grinding-replit-finally-found-its-market-can-it-keep-it/). Dollar budgets alone cannot prevent the worst failures.
- **Up to 84.2% attack success rate** for tool poisoning in benchmark settings under auto-approval ([MCP-ITP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07395))
- **41–87% failure rates** in multi-agent coordination ([UC Berkeley MAST study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657))
- **64% of $1B+ companies** have already lost >$1M to AI failures broadly ([EY survey](https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/emerging-technologies/ey-ai-survey-2024.pdf))

## How to read this report

Each incident includes:

- **What happened** — the failure, in one paragraph
- **Cost** — model spend vs business impact (where both are known)
- **Source** — linked to the original disclosure, research paper, or reporting
- **Root cause** — why existing controls didn't prevent it
- **Prevention** — which runtime control would have stopped it before execution

Incidents are categorized as:
- **Documented** — sourced from public disclosures, research papers, vendor post-mortems, or security advisories
- **Pattern-based** — constructed from real failure modes observed across production deployments (marked with ⚙️)

## Category A: Cost Explosions

Agents that spend more than expected — through loops, retries, fan-out, or scope creep. These are pattern-based scenarios (⚙️) constructed from real failure modes — see Categories B and C for externally documented incidents from named companies and security researchers.

### A1. Coding agent retry loop — $4,200 ⚙️

A coding agent hit an ambiguous error, retried with expanding context windows, and [looped 240 times over three hours](/blog/ai-agent-failures-budget-controls-prevent). Total cost: $4,200. Three dashboards showed the spend in real time. None could stop it.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $4,200 |
| Business impact | Budget exhausted, all agents blocked by provider cap |
| Root cause | Provider cap is monthly/org-wide — doesn't enforce per-run |
| Prevention | **Budget gate** — $15 per-run cap stops at 8 iterations |

### A2. Weekend backlog processing — $12,400 ⚙️

A coding agent [deployed Friday afternoon processed a 2,300-item backlog over the weekend](/blog/ai-agent-failures-budget-controls-prevent) without budget enforcement. Context windows grew per item, retries compounded, and nobody checked until Monday.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $12,400 |
| Business impact | Weekend budget consumed, Monday recovery |
| Root cause | No per-batch or per-task budget limit |
| Prevention | **Budget gate** — per-task cap of $5 limits total to ~$2,500 |

### A3. Concurrent agent burst — 6.4x overrun ⚙️

Twenty concurrent agents [processing 200 documents simultaneously](/blog/ai-agent-failures-budget-controls-prevent) hit a TOCTOU race condition. All read "budget remaining: $500" and all proceeded. Actual spend: $3,200.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $3,200 (budget was $500) |
| Business impact | 6.4x budget overrun |
| Root cause | Application-level counter lacks atomicity |
| Prevention | **Atomic reservation** — budget locked before execution, concurrent reads see accurate remaining |

### A4. Retry storm during CRM outage — $1,800 ⚙️

A CRM returns 500 errors for 12 minutes. [Retry logic at tool, step, and orchestration layers compound](/blog/ai-agent-failures-budget-controls-prevent) — 27x multiplication across 45 active conversations. Cost: $1,800 in 12 minutes.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $1,800 |
| Business impact | All tenant budgets affected during the storm |
| Root cause | Retry multiplier at each layer; no cumulative check |
| Prevention | **Budget gate** — per-conversation cap ($2) limits total to ~$76 |

::: details Additional anecdotal reports (self-published sources)
Two widely cited cost incidents come from self-published sources and should be treated as pattern-confirming rather than independently verified:

- **POC-to-production scaling — $847K/month.** A proof-of-concept agent costing $500/month [scaled to $847,000/month](https://medium.com/@klaushofenbitzer/token-cost-trap-why-your-ai-agents-roi-breaks-at-scale-and-how-to-fix-it-4e4a9f6f5b9a) in production due to call volume assumptions that didn't account for context window growth, retries, and fan-out. (Source: Medium, Klaus Hofenbitzer)
- **Data enrichment API loop — $47,000.** A data enrichment agent [misinterpreted an API error and ran 2.3 million calls over a weekend](https://rocketedge.com/2026/03/15/your-ai-agent-bill-is-30x-higher-than-it-needs-to-be-the-6-tier-fix/). The API returned 200 OK with an error body; the agent treated it as success and retried the entire batch. (Source: RocketEdge)

Both illustrate the same failure mode as A1–A4: no cumulative spend enforcement.
:::

## Category B: Action Failures

Agents that take wrong, excessive, or unauthorized actions — where the damage is in the consequence, not the tokens.

### B1. 200 wrong emails — $1.40 in tokens, $50K+ in damage ⚙️

A support agent [sent 200 collections emails instead of welcome emails](/blog/ai-agent-action-control-hard-limits-side-effects). A prompt regression changed the template selection. Total model spend: $1.40. Business impact: 34 support tickets, 12 social media complaints, $50K+ in lost pipeline.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $1.40 |
| Business impact | $50,000+ in lost pipeline |
| Root cause | No action-level enforcement — dollar budget was nowhere near exhausted |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — [RISK_POINTS](/concepts/action-authority-controlling-what-agents-do) cap on email tool (50 points/email × 4 max = 200 points) blocks email #5 |

### B2. Replit AI deletes production database

Replit's AI coding assistant [deleted a user's production database](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/after-nine-years-of-grinding-replit-finally-found-its-market-can-it-keep-it/) containing 100+ executive contacts, then fabricated 4,000 fake records to cover its tracks.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | ~$2.00 |
| Business impact | Production data loss, fabricated records |
| Source | TechCrunch, October 2025 |
| Root cause | No pre-execution check on database mutation tools |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — database DELETE scored as Tier 4 action (50+ risk points), blocked without explicit authorization |

### B3. OpenAI Operator unauthorized purchase — $31.43

OpenAI's Operator agent [made an unauthorized $31.43 purchase from Instacart](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/31/openai_operator_agent/), bypassing user confirmation safeguards.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | ~$0.80 |
| Business impact | Unauthorized financial transaction |
| Source | The Register, January 2025 |
| Root cause | No pre-execution authorization for payment actions |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — payment processing scored as Tier 4 (50+ risk points), requires explicit budget allocation |

### B4. Accidental production deploy ⚙️

A coding agent, while debugging CI, [triggers a production deployment](/blog/ai-agent-action-failures-runtime-authority-prevents) with an untested fix. Total model cost: $0.80. Business impact: production downtime.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $0.80 |
| Business impact | Production downtime |
| Root cause | No action-level gate on deploy tools |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — deploy tools scored as Tier 4 (100 risk points), gated separately from the dollar budget |

### B5. Slack data leak ⚙️

A support agent [posts diagnostic information containing internal system names and another customer's tenant ID](/blog/ai-agent-action-failures-runtime-authority-prevents) to an external customer-facing Slack channel.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $0.30 |
| Business impact | Data exposure, security review, possible compliance notification |
| Root cause | No distinction between internal and external channel tools |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — external Slack posting scored as Tier 3 (20 risk points), limited per run |

### B6. Jira ticket storm ⚙️

A workflow agent [parses a 50-line stack trace incorrectly](/blog/ai-agent-action-failures-runtime-authority-prevents), creates 50 tickets from a single trace. Across 10 error reports, hundreds of duplicate tickets flood the on-call team in 8 minutes.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | $3.50 |
| Business impact | On-call team flooded, incident response disrupted |
| Root cause | No per-run cap on ticket creation actions |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — ticket creation scored as Tier 3 (20 risk points), capped at 10 per run |

## Category C: Security Incidents

Attacks exploiting the agent tool layer — tool poisoning, supply chain, privilege escalation, and infrastructure exposure.

### C1. postmark-mcp — silent email exfiltration

The first confirmed malicious MCP server in the wild: `postmark-mcp` [silently BCC'd every outgoing email](https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-mcp-server-on-npm-postmark-mcp-harvests-emails/) to an attacker-controlled address. It ran for weeks before detection. No user interaction required.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | N/A (infrastructure attack) |
| Business impact | All outgoing emails exfiltrated |
| Source | Snyk, 2026 |
| Root cause | No tool-call authorization layer; agent trusts any installed MCP server |
| Prevention | **Action gate + audit trail** — tool allowlist restricts which tools can be called; every invocation logged with full scope |

### C2. ClawJacked — WebSocket agent hijacking

Researchers demonstrated that malicious websites can [hijack locally-running AI agents via WebSocket](https://blog.sshh.io/p/everything-wrong-with-mcp), executing arbitrary tool calls through the user's agent session.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model cost | N/A (attack vector) |
| Business impact | Arbitrary action execution under user's identity |
| Source | Security research, February 2026 |
| Root cause | No authentication between agent host and tool server |
| Prevention | **Scope isolation** — per-session budget limits blast radius even if session is compromised |

### C3. ClawHub malicious skills — 341 credential-stealing tools

Researchers [found 341 malicious ClawHub skills](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-find-341-malicious-clawhub.html) designed to steal credentials, exfiltrate data, or execute unauthorized actions. Separately, the [ClawJacked disclosure](https://blog.sshh.io/p/everything-wrong-with-mcp) identified 71 additional malicious skills using WebSocket hijacking techniques.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Scale | 341 malicious skills (Koi Security) + 71 (ClawJacked) |
| Source | [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-find-341-malicious-clawhub.html), February 2026 |
| Root cause | No vetting, signing, or sandboxing of community tools |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — tool allowlist restricts agent to vetted tools only; unknown tools blocked before execution |

### C4. Exposed MCP servers — zero authentication

Trend Micro [found 492 internet-exposed MCP servers](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/mcp-security-network-exposed-servers-are-backdoors-to-your-private-data) with no client authentication or traffic encryption. Separately, Knostic [reported 1,862 exposed MCP servers](https://blog.sshh.io/p/everything-wrong-with-mcp), sampled 119, and found all 119 allowed access to internal tool listings without authentication.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Scale | 492 exposed ([Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/mcp-security-network-exposed-servers-are-backdoors-to-your-private-data)) + 1,862 exposed ([Knostic](https://blog.sshh.io/p/everything-wrong-with-mcp)) |
| Source | Trend Micro, Knostic, 2026 |
| Root cause | MCP protocol has no built-in authentication |
| Prevention | **Scope isolation** — even unauthenticated access is bounded by per-tenant budget; blast radius contained |

### C5. Tool poisoning — 84% success rate

The [MCP-ITP benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07395) achieved up to 84.2% attack success rate (ASR) in benchmark settings under auto-approval. Attacks include rug pulls (tool changes behavior post-install), schema poisoning (hidden instructions in descriptions), and tool shadowing (malicious tool overrides legitimate one).

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Success rate | 84.2% with auto-approval |
| Source | MCP-ITP framework (Ruiqi Li et al., 2026) |
| Root cause | Agent trusts tool descriptions and auto-approves calls |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — per-tool risk scoring, tool allowlists, pre-execution authorization |

### C6. 30+ CVEs in 60 days

Security researchers documented [more than 30 CVEs](https://medium.com/ai-security-hub/mcps-first-year-what-30-cves-and-500-server-scans-tell-us-about-ai-s-fastest-growing-attack-6d183fc9497f) against MCP implementations in the first 60 days of widespread adoption. The average security score across 17 popular MCP server audits was **34 out of 100**.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Scale | 30+ CVEs, average security score 34/100 |
| Source | AI Security Hub, 2026 |
| Root cause | Rapid adoption without security review |
| Prevention | **Audit trail** — every tool invocation logged; anomalous patterns detectable |

### C7. GitHub Copilot RCE — CVE-2025-53773

A vulnerability in GitHub Copilot [enabled prompt injection to execute arbitrary code](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53773) on developer machines.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Impact | Arbitrary code execution |
| Source | CVE-2025-53773 |
| Root cause | No isolation between model reasoning and tool execution |
| Prevention | **Action gate** — code execution tools gated as Tier 4, require explicit budget allocation |

### C8. Rogue agent collaboration

Researchers [demonstrated](https://www.theregister.com/2026/03/12/rogue_ai_agents_worked_together/) that compromised agents in multi-agent architectures can coordinate to escalate privileges and compromise downstream systems.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Impact | Cascading privilege escalation |
| Source | The Register, March 2026 |
| Root cause | No per-agent budget isolation in multi-agent systems |
| Prevention | **Scope isolation** — per-agent budget caps prevent any single agent from exceeding its allocation, even if compromised |

## Category D: Multi-Agent and Systemic Failures

Failures that emerge from agent interactions, coordination, and systemic properties.

### D1. UC Berkeley MAST — 41–87% failure rates

UC Berkeley's [MAST study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657) analyzed 1,642 execution traces across 7 multi-agent frameworks and found 14 distinct failure modes with 41–87% failure rates. Failure categories: system design issues (44.2%), inter-agent misalignment (32.3%), task verification failures (23.5%).

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Failure rate | 41–87% across frameworks |
| Cost multiplier | 3–7x for misalignment failures |
| Source | [UC Berkeley MAST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657), NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight |
| Root cause | No per-agent or per-delegation budget enforcement |
| Prevention | **Scope isolation + budget gate** — hierarchical budgets (tenant → workflow → agent) bound each agent's spend and actions independently |

### D2. Google DeepMind — 17x error amplification

[Google DeepMind research](https://research.google/blog/towards-a-science-of-scaling-agent-systems-when-and-why-agent-systems-work/) found that multi-agent networks amplify errors by 17x. A 95% per-agent reliability rate yields only 36% overall reliability in a 20-step chain.

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Amplification | 17x error multiplication |
| Source | Google Research, January 2026 |
| Root cause | Errors propagate and compound across agent boundaries |
| Prevention | **Scope isolation** — per-agent budgets ensure one agent's failure doesn't exhaust another's resources |

### D3. Silent failures — 200 OK masking wrong results

An agent returns HTTP 200 for every call, but [the underlying data is wrong](/blog/ai-agent-silent-failures-why-200-ok-is-the-most-dangerous-response). In multi-step workflows, the error propagates through 10+ downstream steps before anyone notices — because every step "succeeded."

| | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detection time | 10+ steps after the error |
| Source | Multiple production reports |
| Root cause | No validation between agent steps; success is measured by status code, not result quality |
| Prevention | **Audit trail** — structured logging of every action enables post-hoc analysis; **budget gate** — per-step caps limit how far a corrupted result can propagate |

## Category E: Industry-Scale Evidence

Statistics from research firms and industry surveys that quantify the systemic problem. These are not agent-specific incidents — they are broader AI adoption data points that provide context for the agent failures above.

| Finding | Source | Year | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 64% of $1B+ companies lost >$1M to AI failures | [EY AI Survey](https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/emerging-technologies/ey-ai-survey-2024.pdf) | 2025 | Covers AI broadly, not agent-specific |
| By some estimates, more than 80% of AI projects fail to reach production | [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2680-1.html) | 2024 | RAND cites the estimate; the underlying rate is debated |
| 55% of organizations had not yet implemented an AI governance framework; among those that had, 46% used either a dedicated framework or extended another governance framework | [Gartner](https://futurecio.tech/the-what-why-and-how-of-ai-governance-in-2024/) | 2024 | The 46% and 55% are not clean complements — different base populations |
| Over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027 | Gartner forecast | 2025 | Forecast, not measured |
| 89% of firms reported no impact on labor productivity from AI adoption | [NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836) | 2026 | Broad AI adoption survey, not agent-specific |

## Control mapping

Every incident maps to one or more runtime controls that would have prevented it:

| Control | What it prevents | Incidents prevented |
|---|---|---|
| **Budget gate** (pre-execution cost cap) | Runaway spend, loops, retries, fan-out | A1–A4, D1 |
| **Action gate** (RISK_POINTS) | Wrong actions, excessive actions, unauthorized actions | B1–B6, C1, C3, C5, C7 |
| **Scope isolation** (per-tenant, per-agent) | Cross-tenant blast radius, concurrent overruns, compromised agent containment | A3, C2, C4, C8, D1, D2 |
| **Audit trail** (structured event log) | Undetected failures, compliance gaps, incident reconstruction | C1, C6, D3 |
| **Atomic reservation** (concurrency-safe) | TOCTOU races, double-spend, concurrent burst | A3, A4 |

No single control prevents all incidents. The four controls are complementary — cost, action, scope, and audit each address a different failure dimension.

## What this means

The incidents in this report share three properties:

1. **The agent had the capability to act.** Every framework gave the agent access to tools — email, deploy, delete, purchase, API calls. The capability was granted at configuration time and never re-evaluated at runtime.

2. **No control existed between intent and execution.** The model decided to act, and the action happened. No budget check, no risk scoring, no scope verification. The gap between "the agent wants to do X" and "X happens" was empty.

3. **Detection happened after the damage.** Dashboards showed the cost spike, logs recorded the wrong email, alerts fired after the deploy. Observation is not prevention. By the time anyone noticed, the consequence had already persisted — emails sent, data deleted, money spent, trust eroded.

Runtime authority — the [pre-execution control layer](/blog/what-is-runtime-authority-for-ai-agents) that decides whether an agent's next action should proceed — addresses all three. It fills the gap between capability and execution with a decision point that checks budget, scores risk, verifies scope, and logs the result before anything happens.

The regulatory frameworks converge on the same conclusion. The [EU AI Act's Article 14](/blog/ai-agent-governance-framework-nist-eu-ai-act-iso-42001-owasp-runtime-enforcement) (for high-risk systems) requires human oversight with a stop mechanism. [NIST's AI RMF](/blog/ai-agent-governance-framework-nist-eu-ai-act-iso-42001-owasp-runtime-enforcement) requires controls proportionate to risk. [OWASP's Top 10 for Agentic Applications](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/) identifies tool misuse, excessive authority, and cascading failures as critical risks. The incidents in this report are what these frameworks exist to prevent.

## Methodology

**Sourcing.** Incidents were collected from public disclosures (TechCrunch, The Register, Snyk), research papers (UC Berkeley MAST, Google DeepMind, MCP-ITP), security advisories (OWASP, CVE database), industry surveys (EY, RAND, Gartner, NBER), and community reports (Hacker News, Reddit, Medium). Pattern-based scenarios (marked ⚙️) are constructed from real failure modes observed across production deployments and documented in the [Cycles incident library](/incidents/runaway-agents-tool-loops-and-budget-overruns-the-incidents-cycles-is-designed-to-prevent).

**Limitations.** This report has survivorship bias — only incidents that were publicly disclosed or studied are included. The actual incidence rate is higher. Cost estimates for pattern-based scenarios use documented pricing models but may not match specific deployment configurations. The "prevention" column represents which control category addresses the root cause — not a guarantee that any specific implementation would have caught the exact scenario.

**Updates.** This report will be updated quarterly as new incidents are documented. If you have an incident to report, contact the Cycles team or open an issue on the [docs repository](https://github.com/runcycles/docs).

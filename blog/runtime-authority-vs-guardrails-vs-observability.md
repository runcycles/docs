# Runtime Authority vs Guardrails vs Observability

A team ships an autonomous agent with reasonable controls. They have observability — Langfuse traces every call, attributes cost by model, and surfaces slow runs. They have guardrails — a loop counter caps iterations at 100, a timeout kills runs after five minutes, and a hardcoded check rejects tool calls that look dangerous.

On Tuesday, the agent enters a retry loop against an external API. Each retry stays under the loop cap. Each iteration finishes within the timeout. The guardrails pass every check. Langfuse logs every trace faithfully.

By Wednesday morning, the agent has made 3,400 calls, consumed $1,900, and sent 340 duplicate notifications to customers. The team finds out from the dashboard.

Every control worked as designed. None of them prevented the damage.

The problem is not that the team lacked visibility or safety checks. The problem is that neither visibility nor safety checks answer the question that actually matters for autonomous systems: **should this next action proceed, given what the system has already consumed?**

Three approaches. Three different questions. Only one acts before execution.

## Three approaches to agent control

| Approach | Question | When it acts | What it controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Observability** | What happened? | After execution | Nothing — it reports |
| **Guardrails** | Is this output or action acceptable? | During or after execution | Content quality, structural validity, per-action policy |
| **Runtime authority** | Should this happen at all? | Before execution | Cumulative spend, bounded exposure, action permissions |

A guardrail can say "this tool output looks unsafe." Observability can say "this run sent 200 emails." Runtime authority can say "this run is not allowed to send any more emails without approval."

These are not competing alternatives. They are distinct layers that solve different problems at different points in the execution lifecycle.

## Observability: what happened

Observability gives teams visibility into agent behavior — traces, cost breakdowns, latency analysis, usage patterns, and anomaly detection. It is essential for understanding what a system is doing and where to optimize.

It is also, by definition, retrospective.

A dashboard shows that Tuesday's agent run cost $1,900, sent 340 duplicate notifications, and overwrote 12 CRM records with stale data. That is valuable for the post-mortem. It did not stop the agent at call number 50, when the damage was still $1.50, one email, and zero corrupted records.

Alerts shorten reaction time. They do not create pre-execution control. An agent making 100 calls per minute accumulates real damage in the minutes between alert and human response. Over a weekend, the gap becomes a chasm. See the [full latency analysis](/blog/cycles-vs-llm-proxies-and-observability-tools#where-observability-stops) for the math.

The fundamental mismatch: observability assumes a human will review and act. Autonomous agents do not wait for humans.

## Guardrails: is this okay

Many guardrails live in application code or middleware — loop counters, max-step thresholds, timeout tuning, hardcoded fallbacks, kill switches, content validators, schema checks.

They are cheap to add, easy to reason about, and effective for common cases. A loop counter that stops an agent after 100 iterations prevents the simplest class of runaway behavior.

But guardrails have structural limitations that surface under real production conditions.

**Not concurrency-safe.** Two agents sharing a budget can both read the same counter, both decide they have room, and both proceed — exceeding the limit without either seeing the violation. A counter is a [checker, not an authority](/blog/vibe-coding-budget-wrapper-vs-budget-authority).

**No cumulative awareness.** A guardrail that checks "is this single action okay?" cannot answer "has this run already consumed too much in aggregate?" Each check is stateless. Nothing tracks the running total atomically.

**Fragmented.** Guardrails accumulate across codebases — one team adds a loop cap here, another adds a timeout there, a third hardcodes a model fallback somewhere else. There is no unified policy surface. No single place to ask: what is this tenant, workflow, or run allowed to do?

**Brittle under retries and fan-out.** An agent that retries five times stays under a per-call guardrail while consuming five times the expected budget. A workflow that fans out into 200 subtasks passes every per-task check while the aggregate cost grows unbounded and 200 downstream systems receive duplicate updates.

Guardrails handle the obvious cases. They do not compose into a coherent control model for autonomous systems.

## Runtime authority: should this happen at all

Runtime authority is the pre-execution enforcement layer. It sits in the execution path and makes a decision before the next model call, tool invocation, or side effect happens.

It governs whether an agent may consume resources, take actions, or create exposure — before the next step executes.

The key properties that distinguish runtime authority from guardrails and observability:

- **Pre-execution.** The decision happens before the action, not after.
- **Enforcement.** The system can block or constrain, not just observe and report.
- **Scoped.** Decisions apply at the right level — per tenant, per workflow, per agent, per run — not just globally or per-action.
- **Concurrency-safe.** Atomic reservations prevent race conditions. Two agents cannot both claim the same remaining budget.
- **Reconciled.** Budget is reserved before execution, actual cost is committed after. The difference is released.

Instead of a binary allow/deny, runtime authority supports three outcomes: **ALLOW**, **ALLOW_WITH_CAPS** (proceed with constraints — use a cheaper model, skip optional steps), and **DENY**. That three-way decision enables graceful degradation rather than hard failure.

## Where each falls short alone

**Observability alone:** You know the agent spent $1,900 on Tuesday. You cannot stop the next Tuesday.

**Guardrails alone:** They work until concurrency breaks the counter, retries multiply the cost, or fan-out exceeds the aggregate limit that no individual check tracks.

**Runtime authority alone:** You can enforce limits and block unauthorized actions. But without observability, you cannot debug denied requests, understand cost patterns, or set accurate limits. Without guardrails, you have no content-level validation — the system might stay within budget while producing unsafe outputs.

No single approach covers the full control surface. They compose — they do not compete.

## How the three work together

```
Agent decides to act
  → Runtime authority: reserve budget, check policy
      → DENY → stop; return fallback or surface limit
      → ALLOW_WITH_CAPS → proceed with constraints
      → ALLOW → proceed normally
  → Guardrails: validate inputs, check content policy
  → Execute action (model call, tool invocation, side effect)
  → Guardrails: validate output, check schema and safety
  → Observability: log trace, attribute cost, surface patterns
  → Runtime authority: commit actual cost, release unused reservation
```

The feedback loop ties them together. Observability reveals usage patterns — which runs are expensive, which workflows trigger side effects, where retries cluster. Those patterns inform limits. Runtime authority enforces the limits. Guardrails catch content-level issues that enforcement does not address. Enforcement events flow back into observability for review and tuning.

Remove any one layer and a gap opens. Remove observability and you enforce blind. Remove guardrails and you permit unsafe content within budget. Remove runtime authority and you observe damage you cannot prevent.

## What Cycles provides

Cycles is the runtime authority layer. It treats agent control as [runtime permissioning](/blog/what-is-runtime-authority-for-ai-agents#how-cycles-approaches-runtime-authority) over spend, risk, and actions — not as an after-the-fact reporting problem.

Before the next action executes, Cycles decides whether it is allowed, under what constraints, or not at all. That decision is made by a [protocol](/protocol/api-reference-for-the-cycles-protocol) — not by a proxy, not by application code, not by a dashboard with alerts.

Because it is protocol-based, Cycles works across frameworks, languages, and providers. It does not replace your observability platform or your content guardrails. It fills the layer between them that most teams are missing.

# Cycles vs LLM Proxies and Observability Tools: Where Budget Enforcement Fits

A platform team runs [autonomous agents](/glossary#autonomous-agent) in production. They have a solid stack: LiteLLM routes model calls across OpenAI and Anthropic with automatic fallback. Langfuse traces every request with per-model cost attribution. Provider caps are set at $10,000 per month as a safety net.

<!-- more -->

On Friday afternoon, a customer's document-processing agent enters a [tool loop](/glossary#tool-loop). It calls the LLM, parses the response, calls a tool, gets an error, and retries — hundreds of times.

LiteLLM routes every call faithfully. That is its job.

Langfuse logs every trace with full cost data. That is its job.

The provider cap is set at $10,000 per month. It is March 7th. Monthly spend is at $3,200. The cap does not trigger.

By Monday morning, the agent has made 4,700 calls and consumed $2,800. The team discovers it on the Langfuse dashboard during their weekly cost review.

Every tool in the stack worked exactly as designed. None of them prevented the overspend.

The missing layer was not routing or visibility. It was **[runtime authority](/glossary#runtime-authority)** — a pre-execution decision about whether the next action should proceed given the remaining budget.

## Three layers, three questions

Most teams building on LLMs end up assembling a stack that addresses three distinct concerns. Each concern answers a different question, at a different point in the execution lifecycle.

| Layer | Question | When it acts | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Routing** | *Which* model handles this call? | Before execution (model selection) | LiteLLM, Portkey |
| **Visibility** | *What* happened during this call? | After execution (logging, tracing) | Helicone, Langfuse, LangSmith |
| **Authority** | *Should* this call happen at all? | Before execution (budget check) | Cycles |

Routing and visibility are well-understood layers with mature tooling.

Authority — the pre-execution budget decision — is the layer most teams are missing.

It is also the only layer that can prevent overspend rather than report it.

## LLM proxies and gateways

LLM proxies sit between your application and the model providers. They abstract away provider differences and add operational capabilities on top.

### What proxies do well

Tools like LiteLLM and Portkey solve real problems that teams hit as soon as they move beyond a single model or provider.

**Model abstraction.** A proxy gives you a unified API — typically OpenAI-compatible — so your application code does not need to handle Anthropic's message format differently from OpenAI's or Google's. Switch models by changing a configuration, not rewriting integration code.

**Fallback and retry routing.** If your primary model is rate-limited or down, the proxy routes to a backup. This keeps your agents running through provider outages without custom failover logic.

**Load balancing.** Distribute calls across API keys or model deployments to stay within per-key rate limits and maximize throughput.

**Cost logging.** Proxies typically log token counts and compute cost per call. Some offer dashboards showing spend by model, by key, or by time window.

**Caching.** Identical prompts can be served from cache, reducing both latency and cost for repeated queries.

These are valuable capabilities. A proxy earns its place in any production LLM stack.

### Where proxies stop

The gap appears when you need to **enforce** a budget, not just **track** spend.

**Proxies only see model calls.** An autonomous agent does more than call LLMs. It invokes tools, writes to databases, sends emails, makes API requests, and triggers deployments. A proxy sitting between the app and the model provider has no visibility into these non-LLM actions. If your agent's tool calls cost money — and they often do — the proxy cannot meter them.

**Proxies report after the call completes.** The model call happens. [Tokens](/glossary#tokens) are consumed. The proxy logs the cost. This is useful for dashboards but cannot prevent the call from happening. By the time the proxy records the expense, the money is already spent.

**No atomic budget [reservations](/glossary#reservation).** When ten agents share a $100 budget and make concurrent calls, a proxy cannot atomically check-and-decrement the remaining balance. Each call proceeds independently. The total can exceed the budget before any individual call sees the overrun.

**No hierarchical scopes.** Proxies track spend per API key or per model. They cannot enforce limits at the level your business actually needs: per [tenant](/glossary#tenant), per workspace, per workflow, per run. If three tenants share the same API key, the proxy cannot distinguish their budgets.

**No degradation signals.** A proxy can route to a cheaper model when the primary is unavailable. It cannot tell the agent "you are at 80% of your budget — skip the enrichment step and return a basic response." That [three-way decision](/glossary#three-way-decision) (allow, cap, deny) requires budget awareness that proxies do not have.

### Comparison

| Capability | LLM Proxy | Cycles |
|---|---|---|
| Model routing and fallback | ✅ | ✗ (not its job) |
| Unified provider API | ✅ | ✗ |
| Cost tracking (post-hoc) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pre-execution budget check | ✗ | ✅ |
| Non-LLM action coverage | ✗ | ✅ (tools, APIs, any action) |
| Atomic reservations | ✗ | ✅ |
| Per-tenant / per-agent scopes | ✗ | ✅ |
| [Graceful degradation](/glossary#graceful-degradation) | ◐ (model fallback only) | ✅ (three-way decision) |
| Caching | ✅ | ✗ |
| Concurrency-safe accounting | ✗ | ✅ |

### Using both together

The proxy and the runtime authority serve different purposes. They compose naturally.

```
Agent
  │
  ├─ Cycles: reserve budget (is this action allowed?)
  │    ↓ ALLOW
  ├─ LLM Proxy: route to model (which provider handles this?)
  │    ↓ response
  ├─ Cycles: commit actual cost (record what was spent)
  │
```

Cycles decides **whether** to call. The proxy decides **which model** handles it.

If Cycles denies the reservation, the proxy is never invoked. Zero cost. Zero tokens. The agent receives a budget-exhausted signal and can degrade gracefully — return a cached result, skip an optional step, or surface a budget limit to the user.

If Cycles allows the reservation, the proxy routes the call as usual. After the response arrives, the actual token count is committed to Cycles, and unused budget from the estimate is released.

**Keep your proxy.** It solves model routing, provider abstraction, and operational resilience.

But do not expect it to govern what an autonomous system is allowed to spend in total.

## Observability platforms

Observability tools give you visibility into what your LLM-powered application is doing. They are essential for debugging, performance analysis, and cost understanding.

### What observability does well

Tools like Helicone and Langfuse have become standard in LLM application stacks, and for good reason.

**Trace visualization.** See every step of an agent run — each LLM call, tool invocation, and intermediate result — laid out in a timeline. This is invaluable for debugging multi-step agent behavior.

**Cost attribution.** Break down spend by model, by trace, by user, by feature. Understand which parts of your application cost the most and where optimization efforts should focus.

**Prompt debugging and evaluation.** Compare prompt versions, measure response quality, and catch regressions. Some platforms include evaluation frameworks for systematic testing.

**Latency analysis.** Identify slow calls, measure time-to-first-token, and track performance trends across deployments.

**Alerting.** Set thresholds on cost or error rates and receive notifications when anomalies occur.

These capabilities matter. Teams that skip observability operate blind.

### Where observability stops

Observability is, by definition, about what has already happened.

**Post-hoc visibility is not prevention.** A dashboard that shows Monday's $2,800 weekend spike is valuable for the post-mortem. It did nothing to stop the agent at call number 50, when the damage was still $30.

**Alert latency creates an enforcement gap.** Even the fastest alert-to-human-response cycle takes minutes. For autonomous agents making rapid calls, minutes are expensive.

Consider an agent making 100 calls per minute at $0.03 per call:

| Human response time | Calls made | Cost incurred |
|---|---|---|
| 2 minutes | 200 | $6 |
| 15 minutes | 1,500 | $45 |
| 60 minutes | 6,000 | $180 |
| Weekend (no response) | 288,000 | $8,640 |

By the time an alert fires and a human responds, the system has already spent. The observability platform reported accurately. It just could not intervene.

**No enforcement mechanism.** An observability tool can tell you "this run has cost $50." It cannot prevent the next call that would push it to $53. There is no hook in the execution path where the observability platform can say "stop."

**No reservation semantics.** There is no concept of reserving budget before a call and committing actual cost afterward. Observability records what happened. It does not participate in deciding what should happen next.

**Autonomous agents do not wait for humans.** This is the fundamental mismatch. Observability assumes a human will review data and take action. Autonomous agents operate continuously. The gap between "alert fires" and "human responds" is exactly when damage accumulates.

### Comparison

| Capability | Observability Platform | Cycles |
|---|---|---|
| Trace visualization | ✅ | ✗ (not its job) |
| Cost attribution | ✅ | ✅ (via hierarchical scopes) |
| Prompt debugging | ✅ | ✗ |
| Pre-execution enforcement | ✗ | ✅ |
| Automated budget denial | ✗ | ✅ |
| Real-time alerting | ✅ | ◐ (via events API) |
| Concurrency-safe accounting | ✗ | ✅ |
| Shadow mode evaluation | ✗ | ✅ |
| Latency analysis | ✅ | ✗ |

### Using both together

Observability and runtime authority form a feedback loop.

**Observability informs budgets.** Trace data shows you what runs actually cost — the distribution of per-run spend, which models drive the most cost, which workflows are bursty. This is how you set accurate budget limits instead of guessing.

**Cycles enforces budgets.** Once you know what runs should cost, Cycles ensures they stay within bounds. Pre-execution reservations prevent overspend. Three-way decisions (ALLOW, ALLOW_WITH_CAPS, DENY) enable degradation instead of hard failure.

**Together, they close the loop.** Observability shows patterns. Cycles enforces limits. When Cycles denies a request, that event appears in your observability traces — giving you visibility into enforcement decisions, not just execution results.

Start with observability to understand your cost profile. Add Cycles when you are ready to enforce it.

**Keep your observability platform.** It is how you understand what your system is doing.

But do not confuse explaining the past with governing the present.

## The full production stack

Each layer in a production LLM stack answers a different question.

```
Agent
  │
  ├─ Cycles (runtime authority)         → Should this action proceed?
  │
  ├─ LLM Proxy (routing layer)        → Which model handles this call?
  │
  ├─ Provider (execution)             → Execute the call
  │
  ├─ Observability (visibility)       → What happened? How much did it cost?
  │
  └─ Provider Caps (safety net)       → Last-resort organizational limit
```

Remove any one of these and a gap appears:

- Without a proxy, you manage provider differences manually and lose fallback routing.
- Without observability, you cannot debug, optimize, or understand cost trends.
- Without provider caps, you have no last-resort safety net.
- Without Cycles, you have no pre-execution budget enforcement. Autonomous agents can spend without limit until a human intervenes or a monthly cap triggers.

These layers do not compete with each other. They solve different problems at different points in the execution lifecycle.

The question is not "which one should I use?"

It is "which layer is missing?"

For most teams running autonomous agents, the missing layer is runtime authority.

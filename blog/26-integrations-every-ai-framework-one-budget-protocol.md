# 26 Integrations: Every AI Framework, One Budget Protocol

When we launched Cycles, the question we heard most was: *"Does this work with my stack?"*

Today the answer is yes — for almost every stack. Cycles now integrates with **27 frameworks** across Python, TypeScript, Java, and Rust. Every LLM call, tool invocation, and agent action in your stack can be governed with the same reserve → commit → release protocol — enforcing spend limits, action boundaries, and risk controls before execution.

## What shipped

We added 9 new integration guides, bringing the total from 17 to 26:

### LLM Providers (8)

## The patterns that matter

### Action authority across frameworks

Every integration enforces the same principle: **no agent action executes without authorization**. Whether it's an LLM call in LangGraph, a tool invocation in AutoGen, or an API request in a Django endpoint — the [reservation](/glossary#reservation) happens before the action, not after.

This matters beyond cost. The same protocol that prevents a $50 runaway spend also prevents an agent from sending 200 emails, hitting a rate-limited API in a retry loop, or executing a high-risk tool without approval. The [OpenAI Agents guide](/how-to/integrating-cycles-with-openai-agents) maps tool estimates to budget — `send_email` reserves 50 [RISK_POINTS](/glossary#risk-points) per call while `search_knowledge` uses zero. The [budget authority](/glossary#budget-authority) decides which actions are cheap and which are expensive.

### Graceful degradation with model downgrade

Most authorization systems have two modes: allow or deny. Cycles gives you a third: **downgrade**.

The [Groq guide](/how-to/integrating-cycles-with-groq) introduces a pattern where agents switch models based on remaining authority:

```python
def chat_with_downgrade(prompt: str) -> dict:
    try:
        return primary_chat(prompt)    # GPT-4o: $2.50/$10 per 1M tokens
    except BudgetExceededError:
        return fallback_chat(prompt)   # Groq Llama 4: $0.11/$0.34 per 1M tokens
```

The agent keeps working. The user still gets an answer. The authority boundary holds — just with a different cost profile. This works because Cycles tracks authority per `action_name`, so the budget authority can set different limits for different models and let the application route between them.

## Multi-tenant SaaS guide

Beyond integrations, we shipped a comprehensive [Multi-Tenant SaaS Guide](/how-to/multi-tenant-saas-with-cycles) — the single most-requested doc.

It covers the full lifecycle of per-customer [runtime authority](/glossary#runtime-authority):
- **Customer onboarding** — automated tenant + API key + budget creation
- **Plan tiers** — Free ($5/mo), Pro ($50/mo), Enterprise ($500/mo) with overdraft limits
- **Per-tenant isolation** — one customer's runaway agent cannot affect others
- **[Graceful degradation](/glossary#graceful-degradation)** — upgrade prompts, model downgrade, feature disabling
- **Tenant suspension** — ACTIVE → SUSPENDED → CLOSED lifecycle

Each customer gets independent spend limits, action boundaries, and risk controls — all enforced at the protocol level with cryptographic tenant isolation.

## Try it

Pick your framework from the [integration overview](/how-to/integrations-overview), follow the guide, and have budget governance running in under 10 minutes.

If your stack isn't covered, [open an issue](https://github.com/runcycles/docs/issues). We're prioritizing based on real user requests.

# AI Agent Cost Control in 2026: A Landscape Guide

> **Part of: [The LLM Cost Control Guide](/guides/llm-cost-control)** — the full pillar covering causes, enforcement patterns, multi-tenant boundaries, and unit economics.

If you're running AI agents in production, you've probably evaluated — or already deployed — at least one cost control tool. LiteLLM for routing and team budgets. Helicone for observability and rate limiting. OpenRouter for unified model access with spending caps.

Each solves a real problem. None of them solve the whole problem.

This post maps what each tool actually does, where they converge, where they diverge, and the architectural layer that sits underneath all of them. It's written for engineers evaluating their production stack — not to sell you one tool over another, but to help you see where the gaps are before you discover them in production. (For a broader comparison of proxy and observability layers as categories, see [Cycles vs LLM Proxies and Observability Tools](/blog/cycles-vs-llm-proxies-and-observability-tools).)

## What each tool does

### LiteLLM: Proxy with team budgets

[LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai) is an open-source LLM proxy that routes calls across providers with automatic fallback. Over the past year, it has grown into a legitimate cost control layer:

- **Per-key and per-team budgets** with `max_budget` (hard cap) and `soft_budget` (alert before cutoff)
- **Budget duration** with auto-reset from seconds to 30 days
- **RPM/TPM rate limits** configurable per key, team, user, and customer
- **Webhook alerts** on budget threshold events (Slack, Discord, MS Teams, custom webhooks)
- **Model access control** — restrict which models a key can use
- **Spend tracking** across keys, teams, internal users, end users, and model/provider dimensions

LiteLLM's budget features are real and useful. A team that needs proxy-layer cost governance with team budgets and rate limits has a lot to work with here.

### Helicone: Observability with cost-based rate limiting

[Helicone](https://docs.helicone.ai) is an LLM observability and gateway platform. It logs every call, tracks cost per request for 300+ models, and offers both request-count and cost-based rate limiting:

- **Automatic cost tracking** for 300+ models with session-level attribution
- **Cost-based rate limiting** via `Helicone-RateLimit-Policy` headers (e.g., $5/hour per user)
- **LLM response caching** — deduplicates identical requests at zero cost
- **Configurable alerts** — cost and error threshold notifications via email and Slack
- **Segmentation** by user, organization, or custom property

Helicone's strength is that it optimizes cost from multiple angles: caching reduces the calls you make, routing reduces what each call costs, and rate limiting caps what you spend per window. It's observability and optimization in one layer.

### OpenRouter: Unified model access with guardrails

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs) provides unified access to hundreds of models through a single API, with a guardrails system for cost control:

- **Per-key spending caps** with daily, weekly, or monthly reset
- **Guardrails** — model allowlists, provider allowlists, data privacy policies per key
- **Budget hierarchy** — multiple guardrails stack; the strictest limit wins
- **Per-member and per-key enforcement** — budgets are scoped, not shared
- **Usage dashboard** with key credit and usage introspection
- **Hard enforcement** — requests rejected when key limit reached

OpenRouter's guardrails are straightforward: set a cap, restrict models, and requests stop when the cap is hit. For teams that route all LLM calls through OpenRouter, this is meaningful cost governance with minimal integration work.

## Where all three converge

These tools are more similar than different. They all operate at the **proxy/gateway layer** between your application and the model provider, and they all address the same core concern: **controlling how much your LLM calls cost**.

| Capability | LiteLLM | Helicone | OpenRouter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost tracking | Per-key, per-team, per-model | Per-request, per-session, per-user | Per-key, per-org |
| Pre-execution blocking | Yes (hard budget cap) | Yes (cost-based rate limit) | Yes (key spending cap) |
| Rate limiting | RPM, TPM configurable | Request-count and cost-per-window | Global per-account |
| Model access control | Per-key model lists | N/A | Model + provider allowlists |
| Alerts/notifications | Webhooks (configurable) | Email, Slack | Usage dashboard |
| Open source | Yes (self-hostable) | Yes (MIT license + hosted service) | No |

If your agents only make LLM calls — no tool invocations, no side effects, no multi-agent delegation — one of these three tools, configured well, can cover most of the cost control problem.

## Where all three stop

The convergence ends when you move past "how much does the agent spend?" to "what is the agent allowed to do?"

### 1. None of them control actions

All three tools operate at the model-call layer. They see tokens in, tokens out, and cost. They don't see what the agent *does* with the model's output.

An agent that sends 200 emails to customers costs $1.40 in tokens. A proxy-layer budget would never fire — the cost is trivial. But the action is catastrophic. [Cost and risk are different failure modes](/blog/how-teams-control-ai-agents-today-and-where-it-breaks) that require different controls.

None of the three tools can express: *"This agent can search freely, but can only send 2 emails and 0 deploys per run."* That requires a unit of measurement for action risk, not just dollars or tokens.

### 2. None of them have atomic budget enforcement

Budget enforcement under concurrency is a hard distributed systems problem. When 20 agents hit the same budget simultaneously, you need the budget check and the decrement to happen atomically — otherwise, all 20 can read "budget has $5 remaining," all 20 proceed, and you get a [TOCTOU overrun](/blog/we-built-a-custom-agent-rate-limiter-heres-why-we-stopped).

- **LiteLLM** syncs spend via in-memory cache to Redis at ~10ms intervals. Their docs note approximately 10 requests of drift at high concurrency.
- **Helicone** enforces rate limits via a distributed store. Atomicity is not documented.
- **OpenRouter** enforces per-key caps. Concurrency handling is not documented.

For single-agent or low-concurrency deployments, this is a non-issue. For 20+ concurrent agents sharing a budget, the drift can exceed the budget itself.

### 3. None of them support delegation attenuation

In multi-agent systems, agent A spawns agent B, which spawns agent C. The proxy layer sees three independent model calls from the same key. There's no way to enforce that B has a smaller budget than A, that C can only use a subset of B's tools, or that the total across the chain stays bounded.

This is the [authority attenuation](/blog/agent-delegation-chains-authority-attenuation-not-trust-propagation) problem: authority should narrow with each delegation hop, never widen. Proxy-layer budgets are flat — they can't express hierarchical scope.

### 4. None of them have a reserve-commit lifecycle

All three tools track cost after the model call completes. The cost is known when the response arrives, not before. If a long response pushes the total past the budget, the spend has already happened.

A [reserve-commit lifecycle](/blog/what-is-runtime-authority-for-ai-agents) locks budget before the action, executes only if approved, and reconciles the actual cost after. This is how payment systems, capacity planners, and database transactions handle the same problem — and how budget enforcement becomes structurally safe rather than best-effort.

## The missing layer: runtime authority

The gap that all three tools share isn't a feature they forgot to build. It's an architectural boundary they operate above.

Proxy tools sit between your application and the model provider. They control the **model call**. Runtime authority sits between the agent's decision to act and the action itself. It controls the **agent action** — which may or may not involve a model call.

| | Proxy layer (LiteLLM, Helicone, OpenRouter) | Authority layer (Runtime authority) |
|---|---|---|
| Controls | Model calls | Agent actions (tool calls, side effects, delegation) |
| Enforces | Cost per key/team/window | Budget per tenant/workflow/agent/action |
| Concurrency | Best-effort | Atomic (reserve-commit) |
| Scope | Flat (key, team) | Hierarchical (tenant → workspace → workflow → agent → toolset) |
| Risk unit | Dollars, tokens | Dollars, tokens, AND [RISK_POINTS](/how-to/assigning-risk-points-to-agent-tools) (action risk) |
| Degradation | Allow or deny | [ALLOW, ALLOW_WITH_CAPS, or DENY](/glossary#three-way-decision) |
| Delegation | No awareness | [Authority attenuation](/blog/agent-delegation-chains-authority-attenuation-not-trust-propagation) at every hop |
| Setup complexity | Minutes (API key + headers) | Hours (server deployment + SDK integration) |
| Routing/caching | Built-in (model routing, response caching) | Not included — needs a proxy layer |
| Ecosystem maturity | Large communities, broad integrations | Newer, narrower integration surface |

This is the layer [Cycles](https://runcycles.io) implements. It's not a replacement for proxy-layer tools — it's the layer beneath them.

## The production stack

In a production agent system, you typically need both layers:

```
Agent decides to act
  → Runtime authority: "Should this action happen?" (budget + risk check)
  → Proxy layer: "Which model handles this?" (routing, caching, rate limit)
  → Provider: Execute the call
  → Proxy layer: Record cost, check window limit
  → Runtime authority: Commit actual cost, release unused reservation
```

The proxy layer **optimizes** what you spend (routing, caching, model selection). The authority layer **enforces** what you're allowed to spend and do (budgets, RISK_POINTS, delegation limits). Together, they cover both cost efficiency and structural enforcement.

**Concrete example:** Budget is running low. The authority layer returns ALLOW_WITH_CAPS (proceed with constraints — use a cheaper model). Your application passes that hint to LiteLLM, which routes to GPT-4o-mini instead of GPT-4o. The agent completes the task at lower cost. Neither layer alone enables this graceful degradation — the authority layer decides the constraint, the proxy layer executes the downgrade.

## Decision matrix

| Your situation | Recommended stack |
|---|---|
| Single agent, single provider, prototype | Any one proxy tool is enough |
| Multi-provider, need routing + fallback | LiteLLM or OpenRouter |
| Need cost visibility + caching | Helicone |
| Need team budgets + rate limits | LiteLLM |
| Need per-key caps with model restrictions | OpenRouter |
| **Agents with side-effecting tools** | **Proxy + runtime authority** |
| **Multi-tenant SaaS with per-customer budgets** | **Proxy + runtime authority** |
| **Multi-agent delegation chains** | **Proxy + runtime authority** |
| **Concurrent agents sharing budgets** | **Proxy + runtime authority** |
| **Compliance requirements (EU AI Act, NIST)** | **Proxy + runtime authority** |

The left column is proxy-only. The right column is where you need the authority layer underneath.

## The honest take

LiteLLM, Helicone, and OpenRouter are good tools that solve real problems at the proxy layer. If your agents only make LLM calls with no side effects, no concurrent budget sharing, and no delegation chains — a well-configured proxy tool is probably enough.

The moment your agents start calling tools that send emails, write databases, trigger deploys, or spawn sub-agents — the proxy layer stops being sufficient. Not because it's bad, but because it operates at the wrong layer. Controlling model calls doesn't control agent actions. Tracking cost doesn't track risk.

That's the gap runtime authority fills. Not instead of proxy tools — underneath them.

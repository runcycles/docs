# Manifest vs Cycles: Routing vs Runtime Authority

At a glance, Manifest and Cycles can look adjacent. In practice, they sit at different layers of the stack.

## What Manifest does

[Manifest](https://github.com/mnfst/manifest) is an open-source LLM router for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), the local-first autonomous AI agent. It intercepts each request, scores it across 23 dimensions in under 2 ms, and routes it to the most cost-effective model. If a model fails, Manifest falls back automatically. A real-time dashboard shows token usage, costs, and model distribution, and alerts fire when spending crosses a threshold.

Manifest's pitch is straightforward: stop sending every query to the most expensive model. Route intelligently and cut costs.

## What Cycles does

[Cycles](https://runcycles.com) is a runtime authority for autonomous agents. Before an action executes, the agent reserves budget. If no budget remains, the action does not run. After execution, actual cost is committed and unused budget is released.

Cycles enforces this across hierarchical scopes — tenant, workspace, app, workflow, agent, toolset — with atomic, concurrency-safe reservations. Instead of a binary allow/deny, it returns a three-way decision: **ALLOW**, **ALLOW_WITH_CAPS** (proceed with constraints like reduced tokens or restricted tools), or **DENY**. That makes graceful degradation possible rather than hard failure.

Cycles is not tied to OpenClaw or any single agent framework. It works across any tool, API, or workflow that needs bounded execution.

## When Manifest is the better fit

If the problem is **OpenClaw model selection and cost optimization**, Manifest is the direct answer. It is purpose-built to intercept OpenClaw queries, pick a cheaper model when quality allows, and give operators visibility into where money goes. For teams running OpenClaw and overpaying on model calls, Manifest solves that problem with a single plugin install.

## When Cycles is the better fit

If the problem is **bounded autonomous execution** — preventing agents from spending without limits across any combination of tools, APIs, and workflows — Cycles is the direct answer. Its docs focus on reserve/commit semantics, atomic reservation, concurrency-safe shared budgets, idempotent settlement, and hierarchical scopes. That is a runtime control-plane story, not a routing story.

## The short version

- **Manifest optimizes and routes** — which model should handle this request?
- **Cycles authorizes and enforces** — is this action still allowed to execute?

They are not the same product category. In some stacks they may be complementary: Manifest picks the model, Cycles decides whether the call should happen at all.

# How Much Do AI Agents Actually Cost? A Breakdown by Provider and Use Case

A team we talked to recently launched their first production agent — a customer support bot running on GPT-4o. They estimated $800/month based on their prototype traffic. The first invoice came in at $4,200. The model pricing was exactly what they expected. The number of calls was not. Their agent averaged 11 LLM calls per conversation, not the 3 they'd assumed. Context windows grew with each turn. Retries on tool failures doubled the call count on bad days. The per-token price was never the problem. The per-agent price was.

This post is a reference guide. We break down current per-token pricing across the major providers, then show what those prices actually mean when you multiply by the call patterns of real agent workloads. If you're planning a budget for an agent deployment — or trying to understand why your current one costs more than expected — this is the data you need.

## Per-Token Pricing by Provider

All prices below are per 1 million tokens. Every provider charges separately for input tokens (what you send) and output tokens (what the model generates). Agents are output-heavy relative to simple completions, because they generate tool calls, reasoning chains, and structured responses.

### OpenAI

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-4o | $2.50 | $10.00 | Flagship multimodal model |
| gpt-4o-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 | Cost-optimized for high-volume |
| gpt-4.1 | $2.00 | $8.00 | Latest generation |
| gpt-4.1-mini | $0.40 | $1.60 | Balanced cost/capability |
| o3 | $2.00 | $8.00 | Reasoning model |
| o4-mini | $1.10 | $4.40 | Compact reasoning model |

### Anthropic

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Opus 4 | $15.00 | $75.00 | Highest capability |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $3.00 | $15.00 | Strong general-purpose |
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | $0.80 | $4.00 | Fast and cost-efficient |

### Google

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25 | $10.00 | Advanced reasoning |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.15 | $0.60 | Optimized for throughput |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | $0.10 | $0.40 | Lowest cost option |

A quick observation: the spread between cheapest and most expensive is enormous. Gemini 2.0 Flash output costs $0.40 per million tokens. Claude Opus 4 output costs $75.00 per million tokens. That's a 187x difference. Model selection is the single biggest lever you have on agent costs — but only if your agent architecture actually lets you swap models without breaking functionality.

## Why Agents Cost More Than You Think

A chatbot makes one call per user message. An agent makes many.

The disconnect between "per-token pricing looks cheap" and "my agent bill is huge" comes down to four multipliers that compound against each other.

### Calls Per Task

A simple Q&A interaction is one LLM call. A coding agent that reads a file, plans a change, writes code, runs tests, reads the output, and iterates is 15-40 calls for a single task. A deep research agent that searches, reads, synthesizes, and cross-references can hit 80-200 calls. The per-token price is irrelevant if you don't know your call count.

### Retries and Retry Cascades

Each retry is a full LLM call, not a cheap repeat. Layered retry logic (SDK, framework, application) can multiply a single failed call into 27 actual calls. We cover the mechanics in detail in [The True Cost of Uncontrolled AI Agents](/blog/true-cost-of-uncontrolled-agents).

### Context Growth

Every turn of an agent conversation appends to the context window. Turn 1 might send 2,000 tokens. Turn 8 sends 16,000 tokens because it includes the entire conversation history. This is not linear cost growth — it's quadratic-ish, because each call sends everything that came before it plus the new content.

For an 8-turn conversation where each turn adds 2,000 tokens of new content:
- Turn 1 input: 2,000 tokens
- Turn 4 input: 8,000 tokens
- Turn 8 input: 16,000 tokens
- **Total input tokens across all 8 turns: 72,000** (not 16,000)

### Fan-Out

Multi-agent architectures multiply everything. A coordinator dispatching to 5 sub-agents turns a single request into 30-50 calls — and each sub-agent has its own retry logic and growing context. See [the cost amplification math](/blog/true-cost-of-uncontrolled-agents#the-math-how-agents-amplify-api-costs) for the full breakdown.

## Real-World Cost Scenarios

Here's what agents actually cost in four common deployments. All estimates use a blended rate of 3,000 input tokens and 1,500 output tokens per call, which is conservative for production agent workloads.

### Scenario 1: Customer support bot

A support bot handling customer questions — looking up orders, checking policies, generating responses.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Conversations per day | 100 |
| Turns per conversation | 8 |
| LLM calls per turn | 1.5 (some turns need tool lookups) |
| Total calls per day | 1,200 |
| Avg input tokens per call | 4,000 (grows with conversation) |
| Avg output tokens per call | 800 |

| Model | Cost per call | Daily cost | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-4o | $0.018 | $21.60 | $648 |
| gpt-4o-mini | $0.001 | $1.20 | $36 |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $0.035 | $42.00 | $1,260 |
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | $0.009 | $10.80 | $324 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.002 | $2.40 | $72 |

The spread is dramatic. The same support bot costs $36/month on gpt-4o-mini or $1,260/month on Claude Sonnet 4. The capability difference matters — but so does a 35x cost difference.

### Scenario 2: Coding agent

An agent that reads codebases, generates changes, runs tests, and iterates on failures. Longer context windows because code files are large.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Tasks per day | 50 |
| LLM calls per task | 25 (avg of 15-40 range) |
| Total calls per day | 1,250 |
| Avg input tokens per call | 6,000 (code context is large) |
| Avg output tokens per call | 2,000 |

| Model | Cost per call | Daily cost | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-4o | $0.035 | $43.75 | $1,313 |
| gpt-4.1 | $0.028 | $35.00 | $1,050 |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $0.048 | $60.00 | $1,800 |
| Claude Opus 4 | $0.240 | $300.00 | $9,000 |
| o3 | $0.028 | $35.00 | $1,050 |

Coding agents on Claude Opus 4 cost $9,000/month at this volume. That's not a bug in the pricing — it's a reflection of running a premium model at agent-scale call volumes. Most teams use Opus for the hardest subtasks and a cheaper model for routine steps.

### Scenario 3: Data pipeline agent

An agent that processes documents — extracting data, classifying content, generating summaries.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Documents per day | 1,000 |
| LLM calls per document | 3 (extract, classify, summarize) |
| Total calls per day | 3,000 |
| Avg input tokens per call | 3,000 |
| Avg output tokens per call | 500 |

| Model | Cost per call | Daily cost | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-4o-mini | $0.001 | $2.10 | $63 |
| gpt-4.1-mini | $0.002 | $6.00 | $180 |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | $0.001 | $1.50 | $45 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.001 | $1.95 | $59 |
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | $0.004 | $12.00 | $360 |

High-volume, low-complexity pipelines are where the mini and flash models shine. Gemini 2.0 Flash processes 1,000 documents per day for $45/month. The same pipeline on a frontier model would cost 20-100x more with marginal quality improvement for structured extraction tasks.

### Scenario 4: Multi-agent workflow

A coordinator agent dispatches work to specialized sub-agents — a planner, a researcher, a writer, a reviewer, and a formatter. Each sub-agent makes its own LLM calls.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Workflows per day | 40 |
| Agents per workflow | 5 |
| Calls per agent per workflow | 8 |
| Total calls per day | 1,600 |
| Avg input tokens per call | 5,000 |
| Avg output tokens per call | 1,500 |

| Model | Cost per call | Daily cost | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-4o | $0.028 | $44.00 | $1,320 |
| gpt-4.1 | $0.022 | $35.20 | $1,056 |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $0.038 | $60.00 | $1,800 |
| Mixed (Sonnet coordinator + Haiku workers) | $0.015 avg | $24.00 | $720 |

The "mixed" row is important. Most production multi-agent systems don't run every agent on the same model. The coordinator and reviewer might use Sonnet 4, while the workers use Haiku 3.5. This cuts costs by 40-60% compared to running everything on the same frontier model.

## The Hidden Cost Multipliers

The scenarios above assume clean execution — no failures, no retries, no runaway loops. Production isn't clean. Here are the multipliers that turn estimates into surprises.

### Retry Overhead

A 5% tool failure rate with 3 retries per failure adds 15% to your total call count. That's the optimistic case. If retry logic exists at multiple layers (SDK, framework, application), failures cascade multiplicatively. A 5% failure rate with three-layer retry logic can produce a 45% increase in actual calls.

### Growing Context Windows

The estimates above use average token counts. But agent conversations grow over time. A coding agent that starts with a 4,000-token context on step 1 might be sending 30,000 tokens by step 20 — because every previous step's output is in the context. The last few steps of a long agent run can cost 5-8x more than the first few steps.

### Tool Call Overhead

Each tool call adds tokens in both directions — the tool call schema in the output and the tool result in the next input. A single function call might add 200-500 tokens of overhead per round-trip. An agent that makes 3 tool calls per step adds 600-1,500 tokens of pure overhead per step, compounding across the conversation.

### Concurrency Spikes

Ten users triggering multi-agent workflows simultaneously means 160 concurrent LLM calls in Scenario 4. If your rate limits can't handle the burst, you get 429 errors, which trigger retries, which create more load. Concurrency doesn't just multiply cost linearly — it creates failure modes that multiply cost super-linearly.

## What Budget Enforcement Changes

Knowing your costs is the first step. Controlling them is the next.

Agent costs are a function of call patterns, not just token prices. A 10% change in model pricing matters far less than a runaway loop that makes 500 calls instead of 50. We wrote about [why monitoring alone isn't sufficient](/blog/true-cost-of-uncontrolled-agents#the-observability-gap) and how [pre-execution runtime authority](/blog/true-cost-of-uncontrolled-agents#runtime-authority-as-infrastructure) closes the gap.

[Cycles](/) provides this layer. Every LLM call checks against a budget before executing. When the budget is exhausted, the call is denied and the agent degrades gracefully.

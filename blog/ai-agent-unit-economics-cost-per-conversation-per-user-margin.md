# AI Agent Unit Economics: Cost Per Conversation, Cost Per User, and Margin Analysis

A B2B SaaS company adds an AI copilot to their customer support product. They price the feature at $15/user/month and estimate $3/user/month in LLM costs based on their pilot: 20 conversations per user per month, 6 turns per conversation, GPT-4o at ~$0.15 per conversation. Gross margin target: 80%.

Month one in production with 200 users: average cost per user is $4.20. Close enough. Month two: $6.80. Month three: $11.50. The average is not the problem — the distribution is. 70% of users cost under $3/month. 20% cost $8-25/month. 10% cost $40-120/month. One user triggered 340 conversations in a month — automated integration testing against the copilot endpoint. That single user cost $310.

The company's overall gross margin on the AI feature in month three: **23%** — far below their 80% target. The top 10% of users by cost consume 72% of total spend. Worse, three users each cost over $200, wiping out the margin from 50+ light users apiece. The product is profitable for most users and catastrophically unprofitable for a few — and there is no mechanism to distinguish between them at the point of execution.

## From Tokens to Business Metrics

Most engineering teams track cost at the wrong level of abstraction. They know their [per-token price](/blog/how-much-do-ai-agents-cost). They know their monthly API bill. They cannot answer: "What does it cost us to resolve one support ticket?" or "What is our cost per active user this month?"

The translation requires four inputs:

1. **Raw token cost** — per-model pricing from the provider
2. **Calls per unit of work** — how many LLM calls does one conversation, review, or document take?
3. **Units of work per user** — how many conversations, reviews, or documents does one user generate per month?
4. **Variance distribution** — what does the cost spread look like across users?

The first three give you the average. The fourth determines whether the average is useful.

| Use case | Unit of work | Avg calls/unit | Avg cost/unit | Median | P90 | P99 | P99/Median |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Support copilot | Conversation | 9 | $0.21 | $0.08 | $0.45 | $3.80 | 47× |
| Code review agent | Pull request | 22 | $1.85 | $1.20 | $4.50 | $18.00 | 15× |
| Document processor | Document | 4 | $0.12 | $0.09 | $0.30 | $2.10 | 23× |

The rightmost column — P99/Median — is the variance multiplier. For the support copilot, the most expensive 1% of conversations cost 47× the median. This ratio determines whether average-based pricing works or breaks.

## Why Variance Destroys Margin Predictions

If you price at 3× average cost — a standard SaaS margin target — you need the cost distribution to be tight enough that 3× average covers nearly all users. For normal distributions, it does. Agent cost distributions are not normal. They follow a heavy-tail pattern because:

**Context window growth is superlinear.** Each turn in a conversation sends all previous turns. A 6-turn conversation sends ~21 message payloads total (1+2+3+4+5+6). A 20-turn conversation sends ~210. The cost scales with the square of conversation length, not linearly.

**Retries cluster.** A 5% overall failure rate sounds manageable. But failures are not evenly distributed — some conversations hit 50% failure rates because they trigger edge cases in tool execution. Those conversations cost 2-3× more than their content suggests, and the extra cost is invisible in average metrics.

**Tool call depth varies 10-50×.** A "what's my order status?" query makes 2 LLM calls. A "help me debug this integration" query makes 30+. Both are "one conversation" in your metrics.

**User behavior is unpredictable.** Some users send one message per conversation. Others send 40-message threads. Some users open 5 conversations per month. Others open 200. The variance in user behavior compounds the variance in per-conversation cost.

| Pricing at | Avg cost/user | Price/user | Margin (tight distribution, CV=0.5) | Margin (heavy-tail, CV=3.0) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2× average cost | $4.00 | $8.00 | 65% | -15% |
| 3× average cost | $4.00 | $12.00 | 78% | 22% |
| 5× average cost | $4.00 | $20.00 | 87% | 55% |

CV is the coefficient of variation — standard deviation divided by mean. Tight distributions have CV < 1. Agent cost distributions typically have CV of 2-4. At CV=3.0, even pricing at 3× average only yields 22% margin, because a small number of high-cost users eat the profit from everyone else.

## Building a Unit Economics Dashboard

Four metrics every team running AI features should track:

**1. Cost per unit of work.** For a support copilot, this is cost per conversation. For a code review agent, cost per pull request. Track the median, P90, P95, and P99 — not just the average. The average masks the tail.

**2. Cost per active user per month.** Total spend attributed to a user divided by one month. Break this out by percentile: what does your P50 user cost? Your P90? Your P99? The gap between P50 and P99 is your variance exposure.

**3. Variance ratio (P95/Median).** A single number that captures how fat the tail is. If P95/Median < 5, your pricing model can rely on averages. If P95/Median > 10, averages are misleading and you need per-user budget enforcement.

**4. Margin per user cohort.** Revenue minus cost, grouped by usage tier. This reveals whether your product is profitable for all users or subsidized by light users to cover heavy ones.

Cycles' `Subject` hierarchy maps directly to these metrics. Each reservation and commit is tagged with a subject — tenant, workflow, agent — so cost attribution is structural, not inferred from API logs after the fact.

```python
from runcycles import CyclesClient, CyclesConfig, Subject

client = CyclesClient(CyclesConfig.from_env())

# Get balance for a specific user's monthly spend
balance = client.get_balance(
    subject=Subject(
        tenant="acme",
        workflow="support-copilot",
        agent=f"user-{user_id}",
    ),
)

cost_usd = balance.committed / 100_000_000  # microcents to dollars
```

With per-subject cost attribution, you can compute all four metrics directly: aggregate by conversation ID for cost-per-conversation, by user ID for cost-per-user, and by user cohort for margin analysis. No log parsing, no reconciliation against provider invoices.

## How Budget Enforcement Bounds Variance

You cannot control variance at the pricing layer. You must control it at the execution layer. Budget enforcement — a [runtime authority](/blog/ai-agent-budget-control-enforce-hard-spend-limits) that makes a deterministic allow/deny decision before every LLM call — transforms the cost distribution from unbounded heavy-tail to bounded exposure.

Three enforcement strategies, each mapped to margin impact:

**Per-conversation cap.** Set a $2.00 hard limit per conversation. Conversations that would have cost $3.80 (P90) or $18.00 (P99) are capped. The agent degrades gracefully — shorter responses, cheaper model fallback, or an explicit "I've reached my limit for this conversation, please start a new one" message. The tail is cut.

**Per-user monthly cap.** Set a $15.00/month ceiling per user — matching the price point. Users who would have cost $80/month are bounded. The feature becomes profitable for every user, by definition. This is the same pattern used in [multi-tenant AI cost control](/blog/multi-tenant-ai-cost-control-per-tenant-budgets-quotas-isolation) for per-tenant isolation.

**Tiered budgets by plan.** Free users get $2/month in agent budget. Pro users get $20/month. Enterprise gets custom limits. The budget enforcement implements the pricing model directly — the hard limit and the price point are the same number.

| Strategy | Without cap | $2/conversation cap | $15/user/month cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avg cost/user/month | $11.50 | $4.80 | $4.80 |
| P99 cost/user/month | $120.00 | $14.00 | $15.00 |
| Worst-case user | $310.00 | $22.00 | $15.00 |
| Feature gross margin | 23% | 68% | 68% |
| Users hitting cap | 0% | 12% | 5% |

The $15/user/month cap turns a 23% margin feature into a 68% margin feature — close to the 80% target — with only 5% of users ever hitting the limit. For those users, the agent [degrades gracefully](/how-to/how-to-think-about-degradation-paths-in-cycles-deny-downgrade-disable-or-defer) — it does not hard-stop. It can switch to a cheaper model, reduce response length, or defer non-critical tasks.

## Cost Per Conversation as a Business KPI

Token pricing is an engineering metric. Cost per conversation is a business KPI. Three patterns for using it:

**Chargeback.** Enterprise customers pay for actual AI usage. Cycles' per-tenant tracking provides the billing data — every reservation and commit is scoped to a tenant, so cost attribution is automatic. The usage report is the invoice. See [Multi-Tenant AI Cost Control](/blog/multi-tenant-ai-cost-control-per-tenant-budgets-quotas-isolation) for the full chargeback model.

**Feature-level P&L.** Treat the AI copilot as its own cost center. Track cost per conversation as COGS. Monitor margin weekly. Set alerts when margin drops below threshold. This is [Tier 3 of the cost management maturity model](/blog/ai-agent-cost-management-guide) — alerting on business metrics, not just raw spend.

**Model routing by economics.** Route simple conversations to GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/1M input tokens) and complex conversations to GPT-4o ($2.50/1M input tokens). The routing decision is economic, not just capability-based. A simple "what's my order status?" query does not need a $2.50/1M-token model. A complex debugging session does. [Routing and enforcement complement each other](/blog/manifest-vs-cycles-routing-vs-runtime-authority) — the router picks the model, the runtime authority bounds the cost.

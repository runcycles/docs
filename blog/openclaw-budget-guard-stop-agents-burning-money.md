# Your OpenClaw Agent Has No Spending Limit — Here's How to Fix That

An OpenClaw agent picks up a customer support ticket. It calls GPT-4o to draft a response, invokes a web search tool to verify facts, decides the answer isn't good enough, and loops. Each iteration costs $0.08. After 200 iterations — about 90 seconds — the bill is $16 and the agent is still going. Nobody noticed because it's 2 AM.

This is not a hypothetical. It's the default behavior of every OpenClaw agent that doesn't have budget enforcement. There is no built-in spending limit. There is no call cap. There is no circuit breaker. The agent runs until the task succeeds, the context window fills up, or someone kills the process.

The [`cycles-openclaw-budget-guard`](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-openclaw-budget-guard) plugin fixes this. Install it, add three lines of config, and every model call and tool invocation is budget-checked before execution. In typical OpenClaw setups, no agent code changes are needed.

And as of v0.6.0, it does more than enforce limits — it actively *detects* the runaway loop. If spending suddenly spikes 3x above the session average, `onBurnRateAnomaly` fires immediately. If the plugin predicts the budget will exhaust in under 2 minutes, `onExhaustionForecast` warns you before it happens. The 2 AM scenario doesn't just get stopped — it gets caught early.

## Five problems you didn't know you had

If you're running OpenClaw agents in production — or plan to — these will hit you eventually.

### 1. Runaway spend

An agent stuck in a retry loop, a quality-check loop, or a recursive research task can burn through your entire API budget in minutes. Provider spending caps (OpenAI, Anthropic) are account-wide, monthly, and react too slowly. By the time the cap kicks in, the damage is done.

**What the plugin does:** Every model call and tool invocation reserves budget *before* execution via a [Cycles server](/quickstart/what-is-cycles). When the budget is exhausted, the next call is blocked — not the one after the alert fires. Burn rate anomaly detection catches sudden spending spikes (like a tool loop) and fires a callback within seconds, before the budget is gone. Predictive exhaustion warnings estimate when the budget will run out and alert you proactively.

### 2. Uncontrolled side-effects

Cost isn't the only risk. An agent can send 100 emails, trigger 50 deployments, write to production databases, or call external APIs — all in a single session. Cost limits don't help here. An email costs fractions of a cent but can cause real damage.

**What the plugin does:** [`toolCallLimits`](/how-to/integrating-cycles-with-openclaw#tool-call-limits) cap the number of times a specific tool can be invoked per session. Set `"send_email": 10` and the 11th call is blocked, regardless of budget.

### 3. Noisy neighbors

In a multi-tenant platform or a team with shared API keys, one user's runaway agent consumes the entire budget. Other agents — serving other users — start failing because there's nothing left.

**What the plugin does:** Budgets are scoped per [user, session, or team](/how-to/integrating-cycles-with-openclaw#per-user-and-per-session-scoping). Each agent draws from its own allocation. One user's spike doesn't affect anyone else.

### 4. No visibility into what agents spend

The agent session ends. You know it cost *something*, but you don't know which tools were expensive, which models it chose, or how many calls it made. Debugging a cost spike means digging through API provider dashboards and correlating timestamps.

**What the plugin does:** Every session produces a [cost breakdown](/how-to/integrating-cycles-with-openclaw#session-analytics-and-cost-breakdown) — per-tool cost, per-model cost, invocation counts, and remaining budget. Attached to context metadata and optionally sent to a webhook. For real-time visibility, pipe 12 metrics into Datadog, Prometheus, or any OTLP collector via the built-in [`metricsEmitter`](/how-to/integrating-cycles-with-openclaw#observability-with-metricsemitter-v050). Enable `enableEventLog` for a full audit trail of every budget decision — useful for debugging why an agent ran out of budget or why a tool was blocked.

### 5. Abrupt failure

The simplest budget enforcement is a hard stop: budget gone, agent dead. But that's a terrible user experience. The agent was in the middle of generating a 2,000-word report and just... stopped.

**What the plugin does:** Before hard limits kick in, the plugin [degrades gracefully](/how-to/integrating-cycles-with-openclaw#graceful-degradation-strategies). It switches to cheaper models (Opus to Sonnet to Haiku), reduces output length, disables expensive tools, and injects budget warnings into the system prompt so the model itself starts conserving resources. The agent finishes the task — just more frugally.

## What it looks like

Install the plugin (no code changes to your agent):

```bash
openclaw plugins install @runcycles/openclaw-budget-guard
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-budget-guard
```

Add minimal config to your `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-budget-guard": {
        "config": {
          "tenant": "my-org",
          "cyclesBaseUrl": "http://localhost:7878",
          "cyclesApiKey": "cyc_live_..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Every model call and tool invocation is now budget-guarded.

For production, add model fallbacks and tool costs:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-budget-guard": {
        "config": {
          "tenant": "my-org",
          "failClosed": true,
          "modelFallbacks": {
            "claude-opus-4-20250514": ["claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"]
          },
          "modelBaseCosts": {
            "claude-opus-4-20250514": 1500000,
            "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": 300000,
            "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001": 100000
          },
          "toolBaseCosts": {
            "web_search": 500000,
            "code_execution": 1000000
          },
          "toolCallLimits": {
            "send_email": 10,
            "deploy": 3
          },
          "lowBudgetStrategies": ["downgrade_model", "disable_expensive_tools", "limit_remaining_calls"],
          "maxRemainingCallsWhenLow": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When budget runs low, the plugin automatically:

1. **Downgrades models** — Opus to Sonnet to Haiku, based on what the remaining budget can afford
2. **Disables expensive tools** — blocks tools above a cost threshold
3. **Caps remaining calls** — limits total calls to prevent runaway loops
4. **Tells the agent** — injects budget status into the system prompt so the model self-regulates

And continuously, the plugin:

5. **Detects anomalies** — burn rate monitoring catches sudden spending spikes (configurable threshold, default 3x)
6. **Predicts exhaustion** — estimates when budget will run out and warns before it happens
7. **Retries through failures** — transient Cycles server errors (429/503) are retried with exponential backoff instead of causing spurious denials
8. **Keeps long tools alive** — automatic heartbeat extends reservations for tools that run longer than 60 seconds

When budget is exhausted, execution stops with a clear error:

```
Budget exhausted (remaining: 0, tenant=my-org, budget=my-app).
Execution blocked by cycles-openclaw-budget-guard.
To resume, increase the budget via the Cycles API or contact your admin.
```

## How it works under the hood

The plugin hooks into five OpenClaw lifecycle events:

| Hook | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| `before_model_resolve` | Reserves budget for the model call (held open for later commit). Downgrades if budget is low. Blocks if exhausted. Checks burn rate and exhaustion forecast. |
| `before_prompt_build` | Commits the previous model reservation (with optional `modelCostEstimator` reconciliation). Injects budget status into the system prompt. |
| `before_tool_call` | Checks tool permissions and call limits. Reserves budget. Starts heartbeat timer for long-running tools. Checks burn rate and exhaustion forecast. Retries on transient server errors. |
| `after_tool_call` | Commits the actual cost. Stops heartbeat timer. |
| `agent_end` | Commits final model reservation. Releases orphaned reservations. Builds session summary with cost breakdown, unconfigured tool report, and event log. |

Every reservation follows the Cycles [reserve-commit-release](/protocol/how-reserve-commit-works-in-cycles) protocol. Budget is deducted atomically on the server — no race conditions, no double-spend, no stale reads.

## Try it without a server

Don't have a Cycles server yet? Use dry-run mode:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-budget-guard": {
        "config": {
          "tenant": "dev",
          "cyclesBaseUrl": "http://unused",
          "cyclesApiKey": "unused",
          "dryRun": true,
          "dryRunBudget": 500000000,
          "logLevel": "debug"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All plugin behavior works identically — model downgrade, tool limits, prompt hints, session summaries — but budget is tracked in-memory. No server required.

## Who this is for

- **Teams running OpenClaw agents in production** — you need hard limits before an overnight run becomes a $2,000 invoice, and burn rate detection to catch loops before they get there
- **Multi-tenant platforms** — your users need isolated budgets so one customer's agent doesn't drain another's allocation
- **Anyone building with consequential tools** — if your agent can send emails, create tickets, trigger deployments, or write to databases, you need call limits, not just cost limits
- **Cost-conscious teams** — model downgrade and graceful degradation let you ship capable agents on tight budgets
- **Teams that need observability** — pipe budget metrics into Datadog, Prometheus, or Grafana via OTLP, and enable session event logs for full audit trails

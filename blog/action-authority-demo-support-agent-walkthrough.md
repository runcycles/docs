# AI Agent Action Authority: Blocking a Customer Email Before Execution

> **Part of: [The AI Agent Risk & Blast Radius Guide](/guides/risk-and-blast-radius)** — the full pillar covering action authority, risk scoring, blast-radius containment, and degradation paths.

A support agent handles a billing dispute. Its workflow has four steps: read the case, log an internal note, update the CRM status, and send the customer a reply. Without a runtime decision layer, all four steps execute — including the email. With Cycles, the first three steps proceed normally. The fourth — `send_customer_email` — is blocked before execution because the `send-email` toolset has a zero-dollar budget. The email function never runs. The customer never receives an unauthorized message.

The tools in this demo are mocked. No real CRM, email service, or ticketing system is involved. The [action authority](/glossary#action-authority) is real. This post walks through the [action authority demo](https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-agent-action-authority-demo) step by step: what the agent does, how the unguarded and guarded runs differ, and what the code change looks like.

## The scenario

Customer case #4782: Acme Corp's invoice shows $847, but their contract says $720. A support automation agent (`support-bot`) picks up the case and runs a four-step workflow:

| Step | Tool | Toolset | Risk level |
|:----:|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | `read_case` | *(local)* | Read-only — no state change |
| 2 | `append_internal_note` | `internal-notes` | Write-local — internal log entry |
| 3 | `update_crm_status` | `crm-updates` | Write-local — internal state change, reversible |
| 4 | `send_customer_email` | `send-email` | Write-external — irreversible once delivered |

Steps 1–3 are internal operations. The CRM status change is a state mutation, but its blast radius is contained — it affects an internal record that a human can revert. Step 4 is different: once the email is sent, it cannot be unsent. In the [action-control taxonomy](/blog/ai-agent-action-control-hard-limits-side-effects), internal notes and CRM updates fall at tier 2 (write-local, reversible with effort) while outbound email is tier 3 (write-external, irreversible). The risk difference is not about cost — all four actions cost the same in model terms. It is about what happens if the action should not have been taken.

## Without Cycles: all actions execute

When the agent runs without Cycles, every step completes with a green checkmark:

```

```

The agent did exactly what it was told. That is the problem. No authorization gate existed, so the email went out unchecked. In production, this means a customer receives a potentially premature or incorrect message — and you find out after the fact.

## With Cycles: the email is blocked

Same agent, same tools, same workflow. The only difference is that each tool call now passes through the [Cycles server](/glossary#cycles-server) before execution. The first three steps still succeed. The fourth does not:

│ was sent.                                     │

╰───────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

The `send_customer_email` function never executed. Not "rolled back." Not "logged and flagged for review." The function body never ran. The Cycles server returned `409 BUDGET_EXCEEDED` on the [reservation](/glossary#reservation) attempt, the `@cycles` decorator raised `BudgetExceededError`, and the agent caught the exception and reported: *"Email blocked — not approved for autonomous execution. Escalated to human review."*

## The code change

The diff between `unguarded.py` and `guarded.py` is:

```python
# --- Import the SDK ---
from runcycles import (
    BudgetExceededError, CyclesClient, CyclesConfig,
    cycles, set_default_client,
)

# --- Initialize the client ---
config = CyclesConfig(
    base_url=os.environ["CYCLES_BASE_URL"],
    api_key=os.environ["CYCLES_API_KEY"],
    tenant=os.environ["CYCLES_TENANT"],
    workspace="default",
    app="default",
    workflow="default",
    agent="support-bot",
)
set_default_client(CyclesClient(config))

# --- Three decorators with toolset scoping ---
@cycles(estimate=COST_PER_ACTION_MICROCENTS, action_kind="tool.notes",
        action_name="append-note", toolset="internal-notes")
def append_internal_note(case_id, note):
    return _append_note(case_id, note)

@cycles(estimate=COST_PER_ACTION_MICROCENTS, action_kind="tool.crm",
        action_name="update-status", toolset="crm-updates")
def update_crm_status(case_id, old_status, new_status):
    return _update_status(case_id, old_status, new_status)

@cycles(estimate=COST_PER_ACTION_MICROCENTS, action_kind="tool.email",
        action_name="send-reply", toolset="send-email")
def send_customer_email(case_id, to, subject, body):
    return _send_email(case_id, to, subject, body)

# --- Catch the budget exception ---
try:
    send_customer_email(case_id, to, subject, body)
except BudgetExceededError:
    # email blocked — not approved for autonomous execution
```

Three decorators. One except. The next unapproved action never executes. The tool functions themselves are unchanged — the same `append_internal_note`, `update_crm_status`, and `send_customer_email` implementations from `tools.py` are called inside each wrapper.

## How toolset scoping works

The control is not in the code. It is in the budget provisioning.

The Cycles scope hierarchy for this demo looks like this:

```
tenant:demo-tenant
└─ workspace:default
   └─ app:default
      └─ workflow:default
         └─ agent:support-bot
            ├─ toolset:internal-notes   → $1.00 budget ✓
            ├─ toolset:crm-updates      → $1.00 budget ✓
            └─ toolset:send-email       → $0 budget     ✗
```

The provisioning script creates $1.00 budgets at every level of the hierarchy — [tenant](/glossary#tenant), workspace, app, workflow, agent — and then creates toolset-level budgets. Approved actions get $1.00; blocked actions get $0:

```bash
# Toolset budgets — approved actions get $1.00
for TOOLSET in "internal-notes" "crm-updates"; do
  SCOPE="tenant:$TENANT_ID/workspace:default/app:default/workflow:default/agent:support-bot/toolset:$TOOLSET"
  curl -X POST "$ADMIN_URL/budgets" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Cycles-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
    -d "{\"scope\": \"$SCOPE\", \"unit\": \"USD_MICROCENTS\",
         \"allocated\": {\"amount\": 100000000, \"unit\": \"USD_MICROCENTS\"}}"
done

# send-email: $0 budget — Cycles returns 409 on any reservation attempt
SCOPE="tenant:$TENANT_ID/workspace:default/app:default/workflow:default/agent:support-bot/toolset:send-email"
curl -X POST "$ADMIN_URL/budgets" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Cycles-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"scope\": \"$SCOPE\", \"unit\": \"USD_MICROCENTS\",
       \"allocated\": {\"amount\": 0, \"unit\": \"USD_MICROCENTS\"}}"
```

When the `@cycles` decorator tries to reserve budget for `toolset:send-email`, the server walks the hierarchy, finds a $0 budget at the toolset level, and returns `409 BUDGET_EXCEEDED`. The decorator raises the exception. The action never runs.

This is the operational model: **approving or revoking an agent action = setting a budget**. Want the agent to send emails? Set a budget for `toolset:send-email`. Want to revoke it? Set the budget to zero. No code changes. No redeployment. No new API keys.

## Why not just use an allowlist?

In this demo, a static allowlist that includes `send-email` would have let the email through. An API key for the email service would have let the email through. Both are all-or-nothing: the agent either has the capability or it doesn't, and that decision was made at deploy time — not at runtime.

The gap is between "can" and "should." The agent *can* send emails — the tool exists, the credentials work. But that does not mean this specific run *should* send this specific email right now. An allowlist encodes the first judgment. It cannot encode the second.

Cycles fills that gap by making a per-action decision before execution. In the demo, the `send-email` toolset has no budget, so the reservation is denied. But the control is operational, not structural — add a budget and the agent can send emails on the next run, without a code change or redeployment. Remove the budget during an incident and all automated emails stop immediately.

This is what [runtime authority](/blog/what-is-runtime-authority-for-ai-agents) means in practice: not a static permission check, but a live enforcement point that can allow, constrain, or deny each consequential action as it happens.

## Run it yourself

Prerequisites: Docker Compose v2+, Python 3.10+, `curl`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-agent-action-authority-demo
cd cycles-agent-action-authority-demo
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r agent/requirements.txt
./demo.sh
```

The script starts the Cycles stack (Redis + server + admin), provisions the tenant and toolset budgets, then runs both modes back to back. First run pulls ~200MB in Docker images; subsequent runs start in seconds. Stop with `./teardown.sh`.

## Next steps

This demo shows action authority for a single agent with three tools. The same mechanism works with multiple agents sharing a budget, risk-point caps instead of dollar budgets, or progressive capability narrowing as budget runs low.

For the conceptual foundation behind this demo:
- [AI Agent Action Control: Hard Limits on Side Effects](/blog/ai-agent-action-control-hard-limits-side-effects) — the taxonomy of consequential actions and why [budget authority](/glossary#budget-authority) alone is not enough
- [What Is Runtime Authority for AI Agents?](/blog/what-is-runtime-authority-for-ai-agents) — the definition of [runtime authority](/glossary#runtime-authority) and how it differs from observability and rate limits

# You Can Vibe Code a Budget Wrapper. You Probably Do Not Want to Own a Budget Authority.

A common reaction to Cycles is:

> "This is useful, but we will just vibe code it with Claude Code."

That is a fair objection.

In fact, for a first pass, it is often true.

A team can absolutely use Claude Code or another coding agent to put a thin wrapper around model calls, track estimated spend, and stop a workflow when some threshold is crossed. That is not hard. The happy path is straightforward. A capable engineer with AI assistance can get something working in an afternoon.

But that is not the real question.

The real question is whether you want to own a **budget enforcement subsystem** in production.

That is a very different thing from generating a wrapper.

## Version 0 is easy

Most teams imagining a build-it-yourself approach are picturing something like this: check a counter before a call, estimate cost, compare against a limit, allow or deny, maybe log the result.

That is a reasonable prototype. It can even create the impression that the problem is mostly solved.

But production systems do not stay that simple for long.

Agents retry. They fan out. They call multiple tools. They fail halfway through work. They share limits across tenants, teams, users, sessions, and workflows. They run concurrently. They move from "call a model" to "send an email," "modify a record," "trigger a deployment," or "place an order."

At that point, you are no longer building a utility function. You are building a control system. The [failure modes are well-documented](/blog/ai-agent-failures-budget-controls-prevent) — and they get worse as concurrency increases.

---

## What a real failure looks like

Here is a concrete example of where the prototype breaks.

You have two agents running concurrently for the same tenant. Both check the balance independently. Both see $20 remaining. Both decide they can proceed. Both run. The tenant ends up $40 over budget.

Nothing malfunctioned. No code was wrong. The logic was perfectly correct in isolation. The problem was that a **checker** reads shared state; it does not hold it.

Now multiply that by ten concurrent agents. Add retries. Add tool fan-out. Add a partial failure that causes one agent to re-run from a checkpoint. Add a policy change that updates limits while work is in flight.

The wrapper that looked like it solved the problem in single-threaded testing is not actually enforcing anything under load. It is observing. That is not the same thing. If you want to understand the real cost of this gap, see [The True Cost of Uncontrolled AI Agents](/blog/true-cost-of-uncontrolled-agents).

## A checker is not an authority

This distinction is the core of the issue.

A lot of internal implementations are really **checkers**. They observe local state, make a best-effort decision, and hope the rest of the system behaves.

Cycles is built to be an **authority**.

That means the system deciding whether work is allowed is not just another helper library embedded in the runtime. It is the place where budget is **reserved, committed, and released** in a way that remains correct under concurrency, retries, and partial failure. The [reserve/commit lifecycle](/blog/ai-agent-budget-control-enforce-hard-spend-limits) is designed specifically for this — atomic reservations that prevent concurrent actors from claiming the same budget.

A checker can say "I think there is still budget available."

An authority says "this portion of budget is now reserved, and no concurrent actor can also claim it."

A checker can increment counters after the fact.

An authority can prevent the next step from happening at all.

A checker helps you observe.

An authority lets you enforce.

That is the line.

## Where DIY starts to get expensive

The issue is not whether a team can build something. Of course they can.

The issue is that once the first version exists, they now own a subsystem that is deceptively central. It sits in the middle of agent execution and has to be correct precisely when the rest of the system is noisy.

That ownership expands quickly.

Now someone has to reason about idempotency keys. Someone has to define reserve-versus-commit semantics. Someone has to decide what happens when estimated spend was higher than actual spend, or lower. Someone has to handle cancellation, release, and overdraft policy. Someone has to make sure two concurrent agents cannot both pass local checks and collectively exceed a shared budget. Someone has to prove that retries do not double-settle.

And once different teams adopt it, the burden grows again.

Now you need policy consistency across services. You need auditability. You need multi-tenant isolation. You need a clean way to evolve enforcement rules without touching every application. You need client behavior that is consistent across languages and runtimes. You need enough determinism that engineers trust it, finance trusts it, and operators trust it.

At that point, the question is no longer "could Claude Code write this?"

The question is "do we want to be in the business of maintaining this?"

For teams evaluating their options, the [AI Agent Cost Management Guide](/blog/ai-agent-cost-management-guide) walks through the maturity model from no controls to hard enforcement.

## AI makes building easier. It does not remove ownership.

This is the broader pattern.

AI coding tools compress the cost of producing software. They do not eliminate the cost of **operating** correctness-critical infrastructure.

That is why teams still use databases instead of asking a model to scaffold a storage engine. It is why they still adopt payment infrastructure instead of rolling their own ledger. It is why they still rely on authentication providers, rate limiters, queues, and feature-flag systems rather than reinventing them every quarter.

Could a strong team build its own version of those things? Yes.

Would that be the best use of its time? Usually not.

The same logic applies here. If budget enforcement is strategic IP for your company, build it. But if what you need is a boring, deterministic control plane that sits in front of autonomous spend and consequential actions, then "we can vibe code a prototype" is only answering the easy part.

---

## This gets sharper once actions have consequence

There is another reason the objection misses the core issue.

It assumes the problem is mostly about **spend**.

But agents do not only burn dollars. They create **exposure**.

They call APIs. They send emails. They update records. They delete data. They trigger downstream systems. They take actions whose impact is not measured purely in cost — which is why the Cycles protocol supports enforcement in [multiple unit types](/protocol/caps-and-the-three-way-decision-model-in-cycles) including tokens, credits, and risk points.

That changes the architecture.

Once the thing being controlled is not only spend but also **consequence**, the enforcement point matters even more. Post-hoc dashboards are not enough. [Provider-level caps](/blog/cycles-vs-llm-proxies-and-observability-tools) are not enough. Local wrappers are not enough.

You need a deterministic answer **before** the next action happens.

That is why Cycles is built as an authority, not a reporting layer.

---

## The buy-versus-build question is being framed incorrectly

This objection often frames the choice as: buy Cycles, or build nothing.

That is not the real tradeoff.

The real tradeoff is: **own a budget authority forever, or use one.**

The moment a team ships its internal version, it has created a dependency that other workflows will start leaning on. From that point forward, every new agent, toolchain, workflow engine, and policy requirement increases the maintenance surface.

And the harder the organization leans into agents, the more important this layer becomes. The [budget patterns](/blog/agent-budget-patterns-visual-guide) that emerge in production — hierarchical scoping, graceful degradation, multi-tenant isolation — are not things that simplify over time.

---

## The only honest answer to the objection

Yes, you can probably build version 0.

What becomes expensive is owning the long tail of correctness, policy enforcement, concurrency control, idempotency, and operational guarantees once the system is real and agents are taking actions with consequence.

That is the gap between a wrapper and an authority.

Some teams should build it. If budget control is core to your product differentiation — if the way you enforce limits is itself a competitive advantage — then own it. That is a legitimate call.

For everyone else, the right question is not:

> "Can we vibe code something that looks like this?"

It is:

> "Do we want to own this as production infrastructure when agents are actually moving money, consuming shared budgets, and taking actions that cannot be undone?"

If the answer is no, that is exactly why Cycles exists.

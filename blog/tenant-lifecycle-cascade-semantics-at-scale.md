# Tenant Lifecycle at Scale: Cascade Semantics

A customer cancels. The support ticket is resolved. You click "close tenant" in your admin console, the status flips from `ACTIVE` to `CLOSED`, the incident is filed. Three days later, a monitoring alert fires: that tenant's webhook subscription just delivered to a third-party endpoint that shouldn't be reachable anymore. An audit check the next week finds one of the tenant's API keys still authorizing reservations in production. By the time the alert rolls up, the post-termination spend on the closed tenant is a number nobody wants to write into a customer-refund line item.

Nothing was deleted. The problem is subtler than that: the tenant was marked closed, but every object the tenant *owned* — budgets, keys, webhook subscriptions, policies, in-flight reservations — kept operating as if nothing had changed. A tenant isn't a leaf in the data model; it's the root of a tree, and "closing" it is a statement about the whole subtree, not just the row at the top.

Multi-tenant platforms that have lived long enough to face this problem — Stripe Connect, AWS Organizations, Okta tenant deletion, Slack workspace archival — have converged on the same pattern: terminal states must *cascade*, and the cascade must be enforceable against concurrent mutations. This post is about what that pattern looks like when the owned objects are AI-agent budgets and reservations, and what Cycles ships to make it safe by default.

## The zombie-budget problem

The category name for the failure at the top of this post is a *zombie object*: a child whose parent has entered a terminal state, but which the system still treats as live. The zombie keeps authorizing operations, emitting events, drawing cost, or exposing surface area until something else notices and manually cleans it up.

In an AI-agent budget system, zombies are particularly expensive because every owned object has an independent decision surface:

| Owned object | What a zombie can still do |
|---|---|
| **API key** | Authorize reservations, commits, and admin calls against closed-tenant scopes |
| **Budget ledger** | Accept new reservations; balance queries still return values the operator assumes are stale |
| **Open reservation** | Get committed or extended even after the owning tenant is marked closed |
| **Webhook subscription** | Keep delivering events to third-party endpoints past the off-boarding date |
| **Policy / rate limiter** | Keep enforcing rules the operator thought were decommissioned |

Any one of these is an incident waiting to happen. Several of them together are a compliance finding.

## Two rules that close the gap

The Cycles governance-admin spec addresses this directly with a two-rule contract, formalized in the `CASCADE SEMANTICS` section of the v0.1.25 governance-admin yaml.

**Rule 1 — Close Cascade.** When a tenant transitions to `CLOSED`, the server performs a strictly ordered sequence against every owned object:

1. Drain open reservations (released with reason `tenant_closed`; no overage debt recorded).
2. Close budget ledgers (final balance snapshot preserved for audit; no new reservations accepted).
3. Disable webhook subscriptions and revoke API keys (either order).
4. Flip `tenant.status` to `CLOSED` last.

Each mutated object writes a dedicated audit entry using a reserved `event_kind` value — `budget.closed_via_tenant_cascade`, `api_key.revoked_via_tenant_cascade`, `reservation.released_via_tenant_cascade`, `webhook.disabled_via_tenant_cascade` — all sharing the `correlation_id` of the originating `tenant.closed` entry, so an auditor can reconstruct the cascade in a single query over the audit trail.

**Rule 2 — Terminal-Owner Mutation Guard.** Every mutating endpoint on an owned object first checks the parent tenant's status. If the tenant is `CLOSED`, the endpoint returns `409 Conflict` with `error: "TENANT_CLOSED"`, regardless of the per-object terminal state. The guard applies across the budget, reservation, policy, API key, and webhook planes. `GET` endpoints remain available — closed-tenant state is readable for post-mortems and compliance evidence.

Rule 1 is about *reaching* a consistent terminal state. Rule 2 is about *defending* that terminal state against the inevitable race with in-flight requests.

## Two implementation modes that look the same to clients

How these rules are implemented can vary. A protocol spec that only accepted one shape would be unnecessarily restrictive, so Cycles' cascade section describes two conformant modes:

**Mode A — Atomic Cascade.** All owned-object terminal transitions plus the tenant flip commit in a single transaction. Rollback on failure. Strongest guarantee and easiest to reason about, but requires a transactional store that can hold the whole cascade under one commit. Works well on SQL; harder on Redis without scripting everything into one Lua call.

**Mode B — Flip-First with Guarded Cascade.** The tenant flip to `CLOSED` commits first. Rule 2 immediately becomes enforceable on every dependent mutation, which closes the door against new activity. The cascade then proceeds across owned objects, either inline in the same request or via a reconciler. Conformant when:

- Rule 2 activates at or before the flip's durability.
- Cascade operations are idempotent (replay-safe if a reconciler retries a partial step).
- Convergence within a documented bound.
- Observable reads of non-terminal children remain consistent until the cascade reaches them.

The important property is that both modes produce the same *client-observable* outcome: once the tenant is `CLOSED`, every mutation against any owned object returns a `409` with `error: "TENANT_CLOSED"`, regardless of which per-object row flipped first. The mode is an implementation detail the spec deliberately leaves open — a transactional SQL backend can deliver Mode A cleanly, while a Redis-backed admin can opt into Mode B as long as the guard activates at or before the flip's durability.

## Where operators actually trip

In several years of watching teams deploy tenant-lifecycle code, three failure modes show up far more often than the zombie-budget story itself:

**Mistaking closure for suspension.** Operators hit "close tenant" when they want "suspend tenant." Closure is terminal. The spec allows `* → CLOSED` from any prior state — including direct `ACTIVE → CLOSED` — but no transitions out of `CLOSED`: `CLOSED → ACTIVE` is not valid, and neither is `CLOSED → SUSPENDED`. Once a tenant is closed, it remains read-only — recovery from `CLOSED` is not supported by design. The reversible path is `ACTIVE → SUSPENDED → ACTIVE`. This mirrors how AWS Organizations treats member-account closure: a deliberate one-way operation, not a toggle.

**Forgetting bulk-action semantics.** If a bulk endpoint — say, mass-revoke of 500 API keys across a tenant — runs while the tenant is closing, the per-row behavior matters. Cycles bulk actions return a mixed response: every row that was mutated reports success; every row that hit the terminal-owner guard lands in `failed[]` with an `error_code` of `TENANT_CLOSED`, and the rest of the batch proceeds. Operators who reach for `--exit-on-error`-style semantics are surprised when a partial bulk continues. The right default is a partial-success rollup, because the alternative — failing the whole batch on any `TENANT_CLOSED` — would mean a concurrent tenant close effectively poisons every unrelated bulk action in the stack.

**Assuming webhook disablement is reversible.** Once a webhook subscription goes to `DISABLED` via cascade, re-enabling it is blocked by Rule 2: the subscription is an owned object of a closed tenant, and the parent check rejects the mutation. Rule 2 is what makes `DISABLED` effectively terminal in the cascade flow. If you need to migrate webhook deliveries to a new tenant, the operator pattern is to provision a new subscription under a new (or still-`ACTIVE`) tenant and drain delivery there — never try to reopen the old one.

The [Multi-Tenant AI Cost Control](/blog/multi-tenant-ai-cost-control-per-tenant-budgets-quotas-isolation) post goes deeper on why per-tenant isolation at the budget layer is a prerequisite for safe cascades. If your budgets aren't tenant-scoped to start with, cascade has nothing to cascade over.

## A close, end-to-end

A close is a status transition on the tenant resource. The admin API exposes it in two shapes: a per-tenant `updateTenant` via `PATCH /v1/admin/tenants/{tenant_id}`, or a `bulkActionTenants` call to `POST /v1/admin/tenants/bulk-action` for closing many tenants in one operation. Both paths trigger the same cascade semantics.

```bash
# Close one tenant via updateTenant
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "X-Admin-API-Key: $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: close-acme-corp-2026-04-23" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"status": "CLOSED"}' \
  "http://localhost:7979/v1/admin/tenants/acme-corp"
```

The response acknowledges the status flip. Under Mode B, it returns once the flip is durable — the cascade across owned objects may still be completing. A follow-up query against the audit trail confirms the aftermath, since the cascade entries are reserved audit `event_kind` values, not event-stream types:

```bash
# Pull cascade audit entries tied to this close
curl -s -H "X-Admin-API-Key: $ADMIN_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:7979/v1/admin/audit/logs?tenant_id=acme-corp&limit=50" | jq
```

You'll see one audit entry per owned object: one `budget.closed_via_tenant_cascade` per ledger, one `api_key.revoked_via_tenant_cascade` per key, one `webhook.disabled_via_tenant_cascade` per subscription, and one `reservation.released_via_tenant_cascade` per open reservation that was drained. All share a `correlation_id` with the top-level `tenant.closed` entry, which is how an auditor reconstructs the cascade without having to cross-join on timestamp.

A subsequent attempt to mutate an owned object under the closed tenant returns the terminal-owner guard's `409`. Reservation lifecycle lives on the runtime plane:

```bash
# Mutation on a released reservation under a closed tenant
curl -i -X POST \
  -H "X-Cycles-API-Key: $TENANT_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:7878/v1/reservations/res-xyz/commit"
# → HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
# → { "error": "TENANT_CLOSED", "trace_id": "..." }
```

A request that tries to authenticate with a key revoked by the cascade takes a different path — the API key check fails at the auth layer before the terminal-owner guard is ever consulted:

```bash
# Revoked key -> auth-layer rejection, not TENANT_CLOSED
curl -i -H "X-Cycles-API-Key: $REVOKED_TENANT_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:7878/v1/reservations/res-xyz/commit"
# → HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized (revoked-key path)
```

Both responses are closed doors, but they're closed by different enforcement stages: Rule 2 (the terminal-owner guard) catches mutation attempts on owned objects; the API-key auth layer catches the revoked-key call before the request even reaches the object it wanted to mutate.

The `trace_id` on either response is the thread back to the audit row and the original reservation. See [W3C Trace Context for AI Agent Debugging](/blog/w3c-trace-context-ai-agent-debugging) for the debug loop that follows.

## How this compares to the patterns you already know

The cascade pattern isn't novel. It's the default in well-designed multi-tenant SaaS:

| Platform | Closure model | What cascades | Reversibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AWS Organizations** | Member account closure | IAM users, access keys, and resource cleanup orchestrated by AWS; the closed account stays visible with a `CLOSED` label for up to 90 days before removal from the console | One-way |
| **Stripe Connect** | Account rejection via `POST /v1/accounts/:id/reject` | Charges refused, payouts held, API keys de-scoped | One-way after rejection |
| **Okta** | Tenant deletion | SSO sessions terminated, service accounts deprovisioned | One-way after hard delete |
| **Slack** | Channel archival (workspace-level has its own process) | Channels made read-only, integrations disabled | Channel archival is reversible (archive/unarchive) |
| **Cycles** | Tenant CLOSED via two-rule cascade | Budgets, keys, reservations, webhook subscriptions, policies | One-way; use `SUSPENDED` for reversible block |

The pattern is consistent: *terminal states must enforce themselves against the whole subtree*, and operators need a distinct *suspended* state for the much more common case of "pause this customer without terminating anything."

## Operator checklist for safe tenant closes

Before you close a tenant in production, the five things worth checking:

1. **Confirm intent.** Is the right state `SUSPENDED` (reversible) or `CLOSED` (terminal)? If in doubt, start with `SUSPENDED`; `SUSPENDED → CLOSED` is legal, `CLOSED → SUSPENDED` isn't.
2. **Drain known long-running workflows.** In-flight reservations will be released automatically with `reason: tenant_closed`, but if your system equates "reservation released" with "agent must retry," now is the time to signal the agent stack that a close is coming.
3. **Snapshot what will be terminated.** List the tenant's open budgets, API keys, and webhook subscriptions via the admin `GET` endpoints before the close. These rows stay readable forever, but downstream reports sometimes aggregate only on `ACTIVE` rows — a pre-close snapshot avoids a surprise gap in month-end reconciliation.
4. **Use a dedicated `Idempotency-Key`.** Close is idempotent — re-issuing on an already-`CLOSED` tenant is a no-op — but the idempotency key lets you safely retry across network flaps.
5. **Verify cascade completion.** Query the audit trail for the tenant and confirm one `*_via_tenant_cascade` entry per owned object, all sharing the `correlation_id` of the originating `tenant.closed` entry. Rule 2 is already active at the moment of the flip, so any lag between the flip and the audit entries is an enforcement-safe interval — but it's still a signal worth paging the operator channel on.

## The takeaway

Closing a tenant is a statement about an entire subtree of owned objects, not a single row. Multi-tenant platforms that tried to make it a single-row state flip built themselves a permanent source of zombie-budget incidents. Cycles' two-rule contract — cascade on close, guard every owned mutation — makes the safe path the default path, and lets both atomic and flip-first implementations meet the same observable contract.

The right way to think about a tenant close isn't "I'll turn this customer off." It's "I'm committing to a terminal statement about every reservation, key, budget, webhook, and policy they own," with the confidence that the stack will enforce that statement even against requests that were already in flight when you clicked the button.

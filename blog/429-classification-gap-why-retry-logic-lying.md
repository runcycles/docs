# The 429 Classification Gap: Why Your Retry Logic Is Lying to You

## The problem is not 429

A 429 is not a single condition.

It is a compressed signal carrying different underlying realities:

- short-term rate pressure
- concurrency saturation
- quota-window exhaustion

But most systems flatten all of them into one decision:

```python
if status == 429:
    retry()
```

That is where the run stops understanding what state it is actually in.

---

## Three different realities hiding behind "429"

In real agent stacks, 429s usually land in three buckets.

### 1. WAIT — transient pressure

```text
Retry-After: 5–30s
```

- the system is temporarily saturated
- waiting is likely to work
- retrying later is reasonable

Correct behavior:

**delay → retry**

---

### 2. CAP — concurrency overshoot

```text
no Retry-After, or repeated short 429s under load
```

- too many parallel requests are already in flight
- the client is amplifying its own pressure
- immediate retries make the condition worse

Correct behavior:

**reduce concurrency or reschedule → then retry**

---

### 3. STOP — quota or long-window exhaustion

```text
Retry-After: minutes to hours
or an explicit quota-window message
```

- this will not resolve inside the current execution window
- retrying is not recovery
- retrying only burns time, budget, and throughput

Correct behavior:

**do not retry → surface immediately or route elsewhere**

---

## What actually happens today

Instead of:

```text
429 → WAIT / CAP / STOP
```

most stacks do this:

```text
429 → retry
```

And once that happens, everything downstream inherits the wrong decision.

---

## The failure cascade

This is not theoretical. The [retry storm incident pattern](/incidents/retry-storms-and-idempotency-failures) — and the [$1,800 CRM outage retry storm](/blog/ai-agent-failures-budget-controls-prevent) — are exactly this failure mode.

**What this looks like in a real run**
```text
attempt 1 → 429 (retry-after: 10800)
attempt 2 → 429
attempt 3 → 429
...
attempt 97 → 429
attempt 98 → 429
attempt 99 → 429
```

Once STOP is misclassified as retryable, the rest is predictable:

- retries consume remaining budget
- fallback may never trigger
- concurrency grows under pressure
- sessions look active but do not progress

This shows up as:

- retry loops
- cost spikes
- stuck agent runs
- long-tail latency explosions

Not because the system is missing retries.

Because it is retrying when it should have changed state.

---

## Why enforcement cannot fix this by itself

Cycles is an enforcement layer.

It is built around a clean [reserve/commit/release execution model](/protocol/how-reserve-commit-works-in-cycles):

- reserve
- commit
- release

That model works.

But it assumes the runtime already knows whether the next action should proceed, wait, or stop.

If an upstream layer sees a quota-window 429 and decides `retry()`, Cycles cannot repair that classification mistake. It can govern the next attempt correctly. It can reserve correctly. It can commit or release correctly.

But it is still governing the wrong next move.

That is the boundary.

Cycles is not a 429 classifier.  
It is budget authority once the runtime has already decided what to do next.

The bug is not in enforcement.

The bug is before enforcement ever runs.

---

## The missing primitive

What is missing is a classification step before retry, fallback, scheduling, or enforcement:

```text
status + headers + provider context
            ↓
     WAIT / CAP / STOP
            ↓
 retry / scheduling / fallback
            ↓
      enforcement
```

That is the right composition.

Mapped into a Cycles-style model:

- **WAIT** → hold or extend the in-flight reservation when appropriate
- **CAP** → reduce concurrency or reschedule before creating the next reservation
- **STOP** → release the reservation and fail, surface, or reroute

That is a clean division of responsibility.

---

## Real example

A quota-window 429:

```text
"You have exceeded your 5-hour usage quota"
Retry-After: 10800
```

Treat that as transient and the run starts lying to itself:

- the same task gets attempted again
- fallback may never activate
- the session appears active
- no meaningful forward progress is happening

Correct behavior is simple:

- classify it as **STOP**
- release any live reservation tied to that path
- route elsewhere or fail clearly

The difference is one decision.

The effect is the entire run.

---

## The deeper issue

This is not just about retries.

It is about semantic collapse.

Different failure modes get:

- flattened
- misclassified
- propagated as the same signal

Once that happens, every downstream layer starts doing the wrong thing in its own way:

- retries are wrong
- scheduling is wrong
- fallback is wrong
- enforcement may be locally correct, but it is acting on the wrong next action
- reporting is wrong because activity gets mistaken for progress

You do not just get bad retries.

You get systems that lose track of reality.

---

## Why this keeps showing up

Because responsibility is fragmented:

- SDKs handle retries
- frameworks wrap providers
- orchestration layers schedule tasks
- enforcement layers govern budget and execution

No layer clearly owns classification.

So every layer assumes somebody else already normalized the signal.

Usually, nobody did.

---

## What needs to happen

We do not need more retry loops.

We need a shared primitive:

> **Classify failure before acting on it**

For 429s, that means:

- **WAIT** → delay
- **CAP** → reduce pressure
- **STOP** → terminate, surface, or reroute

Everything downstream gets better once that decision is honest:

- retry logic stops pretending all pressure is transient
- schedulers stop amplifying the problem
- fallback gets a chance to work
- budget authority governs the correct execution path instead of the wrong one

---

## Where this fits

This should not live inside enforcement.

That is too late.

It also should not be buried differently inside every framework wrapper, because then the semantics fragment again.

It should exist as a small upstream layer that reads the real response:

- status
- headers
- provider error text
- execution context

and returns a normalized decision that the rest of the stack can trust.

---

## Closing

Most systems don't fail because they lack retries.

They fail because they act on the wrong decision.

429 is not a retry signal.

It is a classification problem.

Until that is resolved, every layer above it is operating on a lie.

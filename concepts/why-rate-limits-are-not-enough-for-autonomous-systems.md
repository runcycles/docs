# Why Rate Limits Are Not Enough for Autonomous Systems

Autonomous systems do not fail like traditional software.

They do not simply receive a request, process it once, and return a response.

They loop.  
They retry.  
They fan out across tools and models.  
They continue after partial failure.  
They make decisions that create cost and side effects over time.

That changes the control problem.

For traditional APIs, controls like rate limits, quotas, and timeouts are often enough. They help bound request velocity and reduce abuse.

For autonomous systems, they are not enough.

## The real problem is not speed

Rate limits answer a narrow question:

**How fast can this system act?**

Autonomous systems introduce a different question:

**How much total exposure is this system allowed to create?**

That exposure may include:

- LLM usage and token spend
- external API calls
- database writes
- message dispatch
- payment instructions
- workflow fan-out
- tool invocations with irreversible side effects

A system can remain within its request-per-second threshold and still create unacceptable cost or damage over time.

That is why teams often discover the problem too late.

Not when the first request succeeds.  
Not when latency rises.  
But when the bill arrives, a workflow loops indefinitely, a tool runs recursively, or one tenant quietly consumes more than intended.

## Why rate limits fail in practice

Rate limits are useful. They should not be removed.

They are just solving a different problem.

Here are some common failure cases where rate limits are insufficient.

### 1. Loops stay within allowed velocity

An agent can call a model every few seconds, remain fully within rate limits, and still burn through budget over hours.

Nothing is “spiking.”  
Nothing looks like abuse.  
The system is simply allowed to continue.

### 2. Retries multiply total cost

A failed step retries.  
Then retries again.  
Then downstream steps retry too.

Each individual request may be valid.  
The accumulated exposure is not.

### 3. Tool calls create hidden fan-out

A single high-level action can expand into:

- multiple model calls
- several external APIs
- database writes
- follow-up jobs
- additional agent steps

Rate limits see individual calls.  
They do not naturally bound the full execution chain.

### 4. Per-request controls ignore tenant-level consumption

A multi-tenant platform may cap each request correctly but still fail to enforce what one tenant is allowed to consume over a run, workflow, or billing window.

### 5. Post-hoc observability is not enforcement

Dashboards can show what happened after the fact.

That is useful for analysis.  
It is not the same as deciding, before execution, whether an action is allowed to proceed.

## Autonomous systems need budget authority

The missing primitive is not better logging.

It is not another dashboard.

It is a way to make autonomous work ask for bounded room to act **before** it acts.

That requires a different control model:

1. declare intent
2. reserve budget
3. execute
4. commit actual usage or release the remainder

This is the model behind Cycles.

## The Cycles model

Cycles introduces deterministic budget control for autonomous execution.

Instead of discovering cost and side effects only after they occur, a system reserves bounded exposure before work begins.

At a high level:

- an action declares expected usage
- budget is reserved against one or more scopes
- work executes only if reservation succeeds
- actual usage is committed afterward (unused remainder is released automatically)
- or the reservation is released explicitly if work is canceled

This changes the control surface from:

::: info
“observe what happened”
:::

to:

::: info
“authorize bounded execution, then reconcile actual usage”
:::

That difference matters under retries, crashes, concurrency, and long-running workflows.

## Why reserve and commit are different from simple quotas

A quota says:

::: info
you may use up to this much over time
:::

A reserve/commit model says:

::: info
this execution is allowed to consume up to this bounded amount now
:::

That makes several important things possible.

### Bounded execution before work starts

If the system cannot reserve enough budget, the action can be denied, degraded, or rerouted before cost is incurred.

### Safer retries

If retries are idempotent and tied to the same reservation lifecycle, the system can avoid accidental double-spend.

### Actuals instead of guesswork

Many systems can estimate cost before execution but only know the true cost afterward.

Reserve/commit handles both.

### Hierarchical control

A single action may need to satisfy limits at multiple levels:

- tenant
- workspace
- app
- workflow
- agent
- toolset

This is hard to model cleanly with flat quotas alone.

## A concrete example

Imagine a customer support agent that can:

- call an LLM
- query a CRM
- search a knowledge base
- send an email
- open a ticket
- trigger a follow-up workflow

A rate limiter can throttle each component.

But it does not answer:

- how much total budget is this run allowed to consume?
- how much can this tenant spend today?
- should this workflow continue if prior retries already consumed most of its budget?
- should the system downgrade from a larger model to a smaller one?
- should the email or ticket-creation step be blocked once the run is over budget?

Those are budget authority questions, not velocity questions.

## What teams usually do today

Most teams solve this in ad hoc ways:

- model-specific caps
- provider dashboards
- cron-based alerts
- tenant usage counters
- best-effort checks inside business logic
- manual kill switches
- custom retry heuristics

These can help, but they are often fragmented and hard to make correct under concurrency.

The result is usually one of two extremes:

- controls are too weak and failures become expensive
- controls are too rigid and autonomous systems become brittle

A proper budget authority gives teams a cleaner middle ground.

## What Cycles is for

Cycles is designed for teams building systems where autonomous software can create real cost or irreversible side effects.

That includes:

- agent loops
- tool-calling workflows
- long-running background execution
- multi-tenant AI platforms
- budget-sensitive inference systems
- infrastructure that must hold up under retries and partial failure

Cycles is not a billing dashboard.  
It is not just observability.  
It is not a rate limiter.

It is a control layer for bounded autonomous execution.

## The practical takeaway

Keep your rate limits.

But do not confuse them with budget enforcement.

Rate limits are good at controlling speed.  
Autonomous systems also need controls for total exposure.

That means introducing a system that can:

- reserve budget before work starts
- commit actual usage afterward (auto-releasing unused remainder)
- release explicitly on cancellation
- apply limits across scopes
- remain safe under retries and concurrency

That is the problem Cycles exists to solve.

# Cycles vs OpenRouter: Runtime Authority vs Routing with Guardrails

OpenRouter is an LLM routing gateway that provides unified access to hundreds of models with automatic provider selection. As of 2025-2026, it has added a guardrails system with per-key spending caps, model restrictions, and data privacy policies.

If you're already routing through OpenRouter, you have some cost control built in. The question is whether per-key caps are enough — or whether you need the deeper enforcement primitives that agent systems require.

## What each does

| | OpenRouter | Cycles |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary role** | LLM router — model selection, provider aggregation | Runtime authority — pre-execution enforcement |
| **Budget model** | Per-key spending cap with daily/weekly/monthly reset | Per-tenant, per-workflow, per-run, per-action scope hierarchy |
| **Enforcement** | Reject requests when key limit reached | Atomic reserve-commit — budget locked before action |
| **Rate limiting** | Global per-account (not configurable per-key) | Not a rate limiter — enforces per-action authority |
| **Model control** | Model allowlist and provider allowlist per guardrail | Model-agnostic — controls the action, not the model |
| **Action control** | None — controls which models, not what actions | [RISK_POINTS](/glossary#risk-points) — per-tool risk scoring and limits |
| **Multi-tenant** | Per-user and per-key enforcement | Tenant-scoped API keys with hierarchical budgets |
| **Budget hierarchy** | Multiple guardrails checked independently; lowest limit wins | Hierarchical scopes — tenant, workspace, workflow, agent, toolset |
| **Alerts** | Dashboard usage alerts per key | Webhook events on budget state transitions (programmatic, PagerDuty/Slack) |
| **Concurrency safety** | Not documented | Atomic Lua-scripted reservations (zero TOCTOU drift) |

## Where OpenRouter's guardrails work well

OpenRouter's guardrails system provides:

- **Per-key spending caps** that reset on configurable intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Model restrictions** — allowlist which models and providers a key can access
- **Data privacy controls** — restrict data handling per guardrail
- **Hard enforcement** — requests are rejected when the limit is reached
- **Hierarchy** — multiple guardrails stack; the lowest limit wins
- **Programmatic key management** — create, update, disable keys via API

For teams routing all LLM calls through OpenRouter, this provides meaningful cost guardrails at the gateway level.

## Where the gaps appear

### 1. Per-key caps vs. hierarchical budgets

OpenRouter enforces budgets per-key and per-user. There's no concept of shared team budgets, workspace-level pools, or organizational rollup.

In a multi-agent system, you might have 10 agents sharing a $100 workspace budget. With OpenRouter, you'd need to pre-allocate $10 per key and hope usage is evenly distributed. If agent A uses $2 and agent B needs $15, B is blocked even though the workspace has $83 remaining.

Cycles' hierarchical scopes solve this: a workspace budget is shared across all agents in the workspace, with per-agent sub-budgets optionally carved out. The scope hierarchy handles aggregation automatically.

### 2. No action-level control

OpenRouter controls which **models** a key can access. It cannot control what **tools** an agent invokes or what **side effects** those tools produce.

An agent routed through OpenRouter that sends 200 customer emails costs pennies in tokens. OpenRouter's spending cap wouldn't trigger. Cycles' [RISK_POINTS](/how-to/assigning-risk-points-to-agent-tools) budget would — because each `send_email` costs 40 risk points regardless of token cost.

### 3. No graduated enforcement or programmatic alerts

OpenRouter offers dashboard-level usage alerts and per-key activity logs. But enforcement is binary: under the cap (allowed) or over the cap (rejected). There's no graduated middle ground — no "proceed but with constraints" response, no threshold-triggered webhook events for programmatic automation.

Cycles provides [three-way decisions](/glossary#three-way-decision): ALLOW, ALLOW_WITH_CAPS (proceed with constraints like model downgrade or tool restrictions), and DENY. Plus webhook events on budget state transitions (`budget.exhausted`, `budget.over_limit_entered`) that integrate with PagerDuty, Slack, and automated remediation pipelines.

### 4. No reserve-commit lifecycle

OpenRouter tracks spend based on completed requests. The cost is known after the response arrives, not before. If a long response exceeds the remaining budget, the spend has already happened.

Cycles [reserves budget before the action](/blog/what-is-runtime-authority-for-ai-agents) based on an estimate, executes only if approved, and commits the actual cost after. The budget cannot be silently drained by concurrent requests. If actual cost exceeds the estimate, the overage is tracked as debt and surfaced immediately.

### 5. Rate limits are global, not configurable

OpenRouter rate limits are global per-account — creating additional API keys doesn't increase rate capacity. This means you can't allocate different rate limits to different agents or use cases.

Cycles doesn't rate-limit at all — it enforces budget authority. But this means you control the throughput profile through budget allocation rather than being constrained by a global rate limit you can't configure.

### 6. No delegation attenuation

When agent A spawns sub-agent B via an LLM call, OpenRouter sees both as independent requests from the same key. There's no way to enforce that B has a smaller budget than A, or that B can only access a subset of A's tools.

Cycles' [authority attenuation](/blog/agent-delegation-chains-authority-attenuation-not-trust-propagation) ensures sub-agents always get narrower authority — smaller sub-budgets, restricted action masks, limited delegation depth.

## Better together: OpenRouter + Cycles

OpenRouter and Cycles operate at different layers. Running both gives you capabilities neither provides alone:

```
Request flow:
  Agent decides to act
    → Cycles: "Should this action happen?" (budget authority, RISK_POINTS)
    → OpenRouter: "Which model handles this?" (routing, provider selection)
    → Provider: Execute the call
    → OpenRouter: Track cost, check key cap
    → Cycles: Commit actual cost, release unused reservation
```

**What this stack gives you:**

| Capability | Who provides it |
|---|---|
| Unified access to hundreds of models | OpenRouter |
| Automatic provider selection and pricing | OpenRouter |
| Pre-execution budget authority | Cycles |
| Action-level RISK_POINTS control | Cycles |
| Per-key spending caps with reset | OpenRouter |
| Hierarchical tenant/workflow/agent budgets | Cycles |
| Model and provider allowlists | OpenRouter |
| Tool allowlists and denylists | Cycles |
| Credit management | OpenRouter |
| Delegation attenuation for sub-agents | Cycles |

**Concrete integration scenario:** OpenRouter provides your agents with access to 200+ models through a single API. Cycles decides whether each action should proceed based on the agent's remaining budget and risk profile. When Cycles returns ALLOW_WITH_CAPS (budget is running low), your application asks OpenRouter for a cheaper model variant. OpenRouter handles the routing; Cycles handles the authority. OpenRouter's per-key cap is the safety net; Cycles' reserve-commit is the precision control.

**Another scenario:** OpenRouter guardrails restrict a key to only GPT-4o-mini and Claude Haiku (cheaper models). Cycles' RISK_POINTS budget independently restricts the same agent to 2 emails and 0 deploys per run. Model access (OpenRouter) and action access (Cycles) are enforced independently — both constraints must pass.

OpenRouter selects the model and provider. Cycles decides whether the action should happen at all. They're complementary, not competing.

## What Cycles does not do

Cycles is not a router or model aggregator. It doesn't provide access to hundreds of models from a single API, handle provider selection, or manage credits across providers. If you need unified multi-model access (and most teams using OpenRouter do), you need OpenRouter or a comparable tool alongside Cycles. The reserve-commit lifecycle adds ~15ms latency per action and requires cost estimation upfront — the estimate can be wrong, and overages are tracked as debt rather than prevented.

## When OpenRouter alone is enough

- All your agents do is make LLM calls (no side-effecting tools)
- Per-key spending caps with daily/monthly resets are sufficient
- You don't have concurrent agents sharing budgets
- You don't need graduated enforcement (just hard allow/deny)
- Single-team deployment without multi-tenant isolation needs

## When you need Cycles

- Agents have tools with side effects (email, deploy, database mutations)
- You need hierarchical budgets (org → team → workspace → agent)
- You need atomic budget enforcement under concurrent agent load
- You need graduated enforcement (ALLOW_WITH_CAPS for graceful degradation)
- Multi-agent delegation chains requiring authority attenuation
- Webhook events for operational alerting and automated response

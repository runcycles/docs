# Runtime Authority vs Runtime Authorization

Two governance terms have started circulating in the AI agent ecosystem, and they sound like the same thing. They aren't.

> **Runtime *authorization*** asks whether an identity is *allowed* to use a tool.
> **Runtime *authority*** asks whether an agent still has *bounded permission* — budget, risk, action exposure — to take this specific next step *right now*.

**Authorization grants access; authority meters and bounds the action.**

A production agent stack needs both. They sit at different layers, fire at different moments, and bound different things. AWS AgentCore Policy, Akeyless Agentic Runtime Authority, and internal agent-IAM patterns focus on identity, intent, access, and real-time policy enforcement — they decide whether an agent identity, intent, and request context are *permitted* to use a given tool or system. Cycles focuses on the bounded-exposure question — whether the tenant has budget left, whether this tool is past its risk allocation, whether the workflow has already taken its allotted dangerous actions.

The term "runtime authority" is used by multiple vendors with overlapping but different scopes. This page spells out the substance distinction: Cycles answers the question identity authorization can't — *should this specific next step still happen, given the budget, risk, and actions already consumed?*

## The two questions, side by side

| | Runtime Authorization | Runtime Authority (Cycles) |
|---|---|---|
| **What it answers** | "Is this identity allowed to call this tool?" | "Does this agent still have bounded permission to take this next step?" |
| **When it fires** | At identity-resolution time, per tool invocation | At every reservation, before each costly action |
| **What it bounds** | Static policy — which identities can touch which tools | Dynamic budget — total spend, risk points, action count, blast radius |
| **What it does NOT cover** | Cumulative consumption, hierarchical scopes, atomic concurrency | Identity-to-tool mapping, credential management, secret rotation |
| **Decision model** | ALLOW / DENY based on identity and policy | ALLOW / [ALLOW_WITH_CAPS](/blog/what-is-runtime-authority-for-ai-agents) / DENY based on budget, risk, and scope |
| **State** | Stateless policy lookup (typically) | Persistent budget ledger with [reserve-commit lifecycle](/protocol/how-reserve-commit-works-in-cycles) |

Both layers fire pre-execution. They're complementary — neither makes the other redundant.

## Where each fits in the production stack

A real agent action goes through both layers in sequence:

```text
1. Agent decides to call tool X
2. AUTHORIZATION: "Is this agent identity allowed to invoke X?"
   ↓ Yes (or DENY → caller informed)
3. AUTHORITY: "Does this agent still have bounded permission for this action?"
   ↓ ALLOW or ALLOW_WITH_CAPS (or DENY → graceful degradation)
4. Execute tool with the constraints from authority's caps
5. Authority commits actual cost, releases unused budget
```

Skip layer 2 and any agent that obtained credentials can do anything. Skip layer 3 and an authorized agent can drain a budget, run a tool a thousand times, or take a high-blast-radius action that exceeds its allocated risk.

## Where adjacent tools fit

We don't ship per-vendor comparison pages against the identity-based agent governance tools — they solve a different problem, and head-to-head framing implies substitution where the right framing is composition. But you should know how Cycles overlaps with what's emerging in this space.

| | Identity / intent-scoped tool access | Per-action risk budget | Pre-execution cost authority | Reserve-commit semantics | Self-hosted, no prompt storage |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| AWS Bedrock AgentCore Policy | Yes | Not publicly documented | Not publicly documented | Not publicly documented | AWS-managed |
| Akeyless Agentic Runtime Authority | Yes — intent-aware access / real-time policy | Not publicly documented | Not publicly documented | Not publicly documented | Cloud / vendor-managed |
| Generic agent IAM patterns | Yes | Usually no | Usually no | No | Varies |
| **Cycles** | API permissions only; downstream tool IAM external | **Yes (RISK_POINTS)** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

The first column is the authorization / intent-policy layer. AgentCore and Akeyless are well-suited for it — they handle identity, intent-aware access, policy attachment, and credential governance. The middle columns are the bounded-exposure layer — that is where Cycles operates. The final column is a deployment / privacy distinction, not a runtime-authority capability per se.

## Better together

A production stack wires both layers in the order shown above. Cycles supplies API keys with permission scopes (`reservations:create`, `balances:read`, `admin:write`, etc.) for the runtime plane, and identity-based authorization tools handle the upstream question of whether the agent identity is allowed to obtain those keys in the first place.

Concrete example — a SaaS deploying customer-support agents:

- **Authorization layer** (AgentCore / Akeyless / IAM): defines that *the support agent's identity* is allowed to call the `send_email` tool, and *the engineering agent's identity* is allowed to call the `deploy_service` tool. Cross-access denied at the policy layer.
- **Authority layer** (Cycles): defines that the *support tenant* has $500/month in tokens, that *email actions cost 40 [RISK_POINTS](/concepts/action-authority-controlling-what-agents-do)*, and that the *risk budget for email* is 200 points/day. Even though the support agent is *authorized* to send emails, Cycles will DENY the 6th email of the day if the risk budget is exhausted — and DENY any LLM call once the $500 monthly token budget is spent.

Without authorization, an attacker who exfiltrates an API key can use any tool. Without authority, an authorized agent can run a tool a thousand times.

## When you only need authorization

- Single-tool agents with low blast radius (read-only, no concurrency, no multi-tenancy).
- Internal-only deployments where the question is "who's allowed to use this tool" and there's no budget to bound.
- Pre-production prototypes where cumulative cost isn't yet a concern.

If you're here, AgentCore Policy or a similar identity-based system is sufficient — Cycles adds overhead you don't need yet.

## When you need authority

- Multi-tenant SaaS where one customer's runaway must not affect other tenants.
- Agents with hierarchical scopes — tenant → workspace → workflow → run — that each need their own budget.
- Tools with side effects (email, deploy, mutation) where you want to bound risk *separately* from cost.
- Multi-agent delegation chains where authority should attenuate at each hop, not propagate.
- Production cost predictability — you need to *prove* a $4,200 overnight runaway can't happen.

If any of these apply, identity authorization alone leaves the budget and risk dimensions unbounded. That's where Cycles fits.

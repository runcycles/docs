# Cycles vs Helicone: Enforcement vs Observability and Rate Limiting

Helicone is a popular LLM observability and gateway platform. It logs every model call, tracks cost per request, and offers rate limiting (including cost-based limits). If you're using Helicone, you already have visibility into what your agents spend.

The question is whether visibility and rate limiting are enough — or whether you need cumulative budget enforcement and action-level control.

## What each does

| | Helicone | Cycles |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary role** | Observability + AI gateway | Runtime authority — pre-execution enforcement |
| **Cost tracking** | Automatic, per-request, 300+ models | Per-scope cumulative budget with remaining balance |
| **Rate limiting** | Request-count and cost-per-window (via headers) | Not a rate limiter — enforces per-action budget authority |
| **Budget enforcement** | Cost-based rate limit blocks within a time window | Cumulative budget with atomic reserve-commit lifecycle |
| **Alerts** | Threshold notifications (email, Slack) | Webhook events on budget state transitions |
| **Action control** | None — all actions pass if under rate limit | [RISK_POINTS](/glossary#risk-points) — per-tool risk scoring |
| **Multi-tenant** | Per-user/per-property rate limit segmentation | Tenant-scoped API keys with hierarchical budgets |
| **Caching** | Built-in LLM response caching (73% hit rate cited) | Not a caching layer |
| **Smart routing** | Cheapest-provider selection | Not a routing layer |

## Where Helicone works well

Helicone's strengths are real:

- **Cost visibility** — automatic cost calculation for 300+ models with session-level attribution
- **Cost-based rate limiting** — `Helicone-RateLimit-Policy: 500;w=3600;u=cents;s=user` caps spend per user per window
- **Caching** — deduplicates identical requests, significantly reducing costs
- **Smart routing** — selects the cheapest provider for equivalent models
- **Threshold alerts** — graduated notifications at 50%, 80%, 95% of budget

For teams that need visibility and basic cost guardrails, Helicone covers the common case.

## Where the gaps appear

### 1. Window-based vs. cumulative budget

Helicone's cost-based rate limit enforces *spend per time window* (e.g., $5/hour). It does not enforce a cumulative budget state ("you have $47.23 remaining this month"). When the window resets, the limit resets — there's no carry-over, no "remaining balance" concept.

Cycles tracks cumulative budget state with a balance that decreases with each reservation and increases with each release. The budget has an `allocated`, `remaining`, `reserved`, `spent`, and `debt` balance at all times. This is the difference between a rate limit and a budget.

### 2. Rate limit headers vs. persistent budgets

Helicone rate limits are configured per-request via HTTP headers (`Helicone-RateLimit-Policy`). There's no persistent budget object that lives independently of the requests. If you change the header value, the limit changes. If you forget the header, there's no limit.

Cycles budgets are persistent objects created via the admin API. They exist independently of any request. Every reservation checks against the budget state — there's no way to "forget" to enforce.

### 3. Alerts vs. enforcement

Helicone cost alerts notify you when thresholds are crossed. They don't block the action. The alert fires, the Slack message arrives, and by then the budget may already be significantly exceeded.

Cycles events also notify — but the enforcement has already happened. The agent's action was DENIED or constrained (ALLOW_WITH_CAPS) before execution. The webhook event is confirmation of what the enforcement layer already prevented.

### 4. No action-level control

Helicone controls request volume and cost. It cannot distinguish between a $0.01 search API call and a $0.01 `send_email` tool call. Both cost the same in tokens — but the email has 10,000x the blast radius.

Cycles' [RISK_POINTS](/how-to/assigning-risk-points-to-agent-tools) budget scores actions by consequence, not cost. An agent can search freely (0 points) while being limited to 2 customer emails per run (40 points each × 2 = 80 of a 100-point budget).

### 5. No multi-tenant budget management

Helicone can segment rate limits by user ID or custom property, but there's no tenant-level budget management — no per-customer spending pools, no hierarchical budget derivation, no team budgets.

Cycles provides per-tenant isolation with hierarchical scopes (tenant → workspace → workflow → agent), where each level can have its own budget and the enforcement is derived from all applicable scopes atomically.

## When you need both

Helicone and Cycles complement each other:

```
Request flow:
  Agent decides to act
    → Cycles: "Should this action happen?" (budget authority, RISK_POINTS)
    → Helicone: Route to cheapest provider, check cache
    → Provider: Execute (or return cached response)
    → Helicone: Log cost, trace, check rate limit window
    → Cycles: Commit actual cost, release unused reservation
```

Helicone optimizes cost (caching, routing). Cycles enforces limits (budgets, action authority). Helicone tells you what happened. Cycles decides what's allowed to happen.

## When Helicone alone is enough

- You need cost visibility and analytics more than enforcement
- Per-window rate limiting (e.g., "$5/hour per user") is sufficient
- Your agents don't have side-effecting tools (email, deploy, mutations)
- You don't need persistent cumulative budget tracking
- Single-tenant or simple multi-user segmentation

## When you need Cycles

- You need a cumulative monthly/quarterly budget with a "remaining balance"
- Your agents have tools with side effects that need action-level control
- You need multi-tenant budget isolation with hierarchical scopes
- You need atomic budget enforcement under concurrent agent load
- You need delegation attenuation for multi-agent systems

# Cycles vs Helicone: Enforcement vs Observability and Rate Limiting

Helicone is a popular LLM observability and gateway platform. It logs every model call, tracks cost per request, and offers rate limiting (including cost-based limits). If you're using Helicone, you already have visibility into what your agents spend.

The question is whether visibility and rate limiting are enough — or whether you need cumulative budget enforcement and action-level control.

## What each does

| | Helicone | Cycles |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary role** | Observability + AI gateway | Runtime authority — pre-execution enforcement |
| **Cost tracking** | Automatic, per-request, 300+ models | Per-scope cumulative budget with remaining balance |
| **Rate limiting** | Request-count and cost-per-window (via headers) | Not a rate limiter — enforces per-action budget authority |
| **Budget enforcement** | Cost-based rate limit blocks within a time window | Cumulative budget with atomic reserve-commit lifecycle |
| **Alerts** | Threshold notifications (email, Slack) | Webhook events on budget state transitions |
| **Action control** | None — all actions pass if under rate limit | [RISK_POINTS](/glossary#risk-points) — per-tool risk scoring |
| **Multi-tenant** | Per-user/per-property rate limit segmentation | Tenant-scoped API keys with hierarchical budgets |
| **Caching** | Built-in LLM response caching | Not a caching layer |
| **Smart routing** | Cheapest-provider selection | Not a routing layer |

## Where Helicone works well

Helicone's strengths are real:

- **Cost visibility** — automatic cost calculation for 300+ models with session-level attribution
- **Cost-based rate limiting** — `Helicone-RateLimit-Policy: 500;w=3600;u=cents;s=user` caps spend per user per window
- **Caching** — deduplicates identical requests, significantly reducing costs
- **Smart routing** — selects the cheapest provider for equivalent models
- **Threshold alerts** — graduated notifications at 50%, 80%, 95% of budget

For teams that need visibility and basic cost guardrails, Helicone covers the common case.

## Where the gaps appear

### 1. Window-based vs. cumulative budget

Helicone's cost-based rate limit enforces *spend per time window* (e.g., $5/hour). It does not enforce a cumulative budget state ("you have $47.23 remaining this month"). When the window resets, the limit resets — there's no carry-over, no "remaining balance" concept.

Cycles tracks cumulative budget state with a balance that decreases with each reservation and increases with each release. The budget has an `allocated`, `remaining`, `reserved`, `spent`, and `debt` balance at all times. This is the difference between a rate limit and a budget.

### 2. Rate limit headers vs. persistent budgets

Helicone rate limits are configured per-request via HTTP headers (`Helicone-RateLimit-Policy`) with Cloudflare-backed low-latency enforcement. However, there's no persistent budget object that lives independently of the requests. If you change the header value, the limit changes. If you forget the header, there's no limit.

Cycles budgets are persistent objects created via the admin API. They exist independently of any request. Every reservation checks against the budget state — there's no way to "forget" to enforce.

### 3. Alerts vs. enforcement

Helicone cost alerts notify you when thresholds are crossed. They don't block the action. The alert fires, the Slack message arrives, and by then the budget may already be significantly exceeded.

Cycles events also notify — but the enforcement has already happened. The agent's action was DENIED or constrained (ALLOW_WITH_CAPS) before execution. The webhook event is confirmation of what the enforcement layer already prevented.

### 4. No action-level control

Helicone controls request volume and cost. It cannot distinguish between a $0.01 search API call and a $0.01 `send_email` tool call. Both cost the same in tokens — but the email has 10,000x the blast radius.

Cycles' [RISK_POINTS](/how-to/assigning-risk-points-to-agent-tools) budget scores actions by consequence, not cost. An agent can search freely (0 points) while being limited to 2 customer emails per run (40 points each × 2 = 80 of a 100-point budget).

### 5. Segmented window limits, not hierarchical cumulative budgets

Helicone supports rate-limit segmentation by user, organization, custom property, or globally — meaningful isolation for many use cases. But these are window-based limits (reset per time period), not persistent hierarchical cumulative budgets with a reserve-commit ledger.

Cycles provides per-tenant isolation with hierarchical scopes (tenant → workspace → workflow → agent), where each level has its own cumulative budget with `allocated`, `remaining`, `reserved`, `spent`, and `debt` balances — derived atomically across the full scope hierarchy on every reservation.

## Better together: Helicone + Cycles

Helicone and Cycles complement each other. Running both gives you capabilities neither provides alone:

```
Request flow:
  Agent decides to act
    → Cycles: "Should this action happen?" (budget authority, RISK_POINTS)
    → Helicone: Route to cheapest provider, check cache
    → Provider: Execute (or return cached response)
    → Helicone: Log cost, trace, check rate limit window
    → Cycles: Commit actual cost, release unused reservation
```

**What this stack gives you:**

| Capability | Who provides it |
|---|---|
| LLM response caching (deduplicate identical calls) | Helicone |
| Cheapest-provider routing | Helicone |
| Pre-execution budget authority | Cycles |
| Action-level RISK_POINTS control | Cycles |
| Cost attribution per trace/session | Helicone |
| Cumulative budget enforcement per tenant | Cycles |
| Rate limiting per time window | Helicone |
| Per-action reserve-commit lifecycle | Cycles |
| Cost anomaly dashboard | Helicone |
| Webhook events for automated response | Cycles |

**Concrete integration scenario:** Helicone's cache deduplicates repeated requests at zero cost — this reduces the total number of actions that even reach Cycles. For uncached requests, Cycles enforces budget authority. Meanwhile, Helicone's per-session cost tracking lets you correlate Cycles' `reservation_id` with trace data for unified debugging. Helicone reduces what you spend. Cycles limits what you're allowed to spend. Together, they form both the optimization and the enforcement layer.

**Another scenario:** Helicone's cost alert fires at 80% of a soft threshold — your team sees the Slack notification. Cycles' budget enforcement fires at 100% — the agent gets ALLOW_WITH_CAPS or DENY. The alert gives you time to intervene. The enforcement guarantees the budget holds even if you don't.

## What Cycles does not do

Cycles is not an observability platform, a caching layer, or a router. It doesn't trace requests, deduplicate responses, or select the cheapest provider. If you need those things (and most production stacks do), you need Helicone or a comparable tool alongside Cycles. The reserve-commit lifecycle also adds [~15ms latency per action](/blog/cycles-server-performance-benchmarks) (p50) — negligible against multi-second LLM calls, but present.

## When Helicone alone is enough

- You need cost visibility and analytics more than enforcement
- Per-window rate limiting (e.g., "$5/hour per user") is sufficient
- Your agents don't have side-effecting tools (email, deploy, mutations)
- You don't need persistent cumulative budget tracking
- Single-tenant or simple multi-user segmentation

## When you need Cycles

- You need a cumulative monthly/quarterly budget with a "remaining balance"
- Your agents have tools with side effects that need action-level control
- You need multi-tenant budget isolation with hierarchical scopes
- You need atomic budget enforcement under concurrent agent load
- You need delegation attenuation for multi-agent systems

# Coding Agents Need Runtime Budget Authority

Coding agents are impressive.

They can search a codebase, scaffold features, write tests, fix bugs, and compress work that used to take hours into minutes. But as autonomous execution gets faster and cheaper, the need for runtime control does not go away.

It becomes more important.

Coding agents and runtime budget authority solve different problems at different layers. A coding agent is designed to complete work. Runtime budget authority is designed to decide whether autonomous work is still allowed to continue, under what limits, and with what reconciliation afterward.

## What coding agents do well

Modern coding agents excel at:

- searching and understanding large codebases
- scaffolding features from high-level descriptions
- writing and updating tests
- fixing bugs across multiple files
- refactoring code to match patterns
- generating boilerplate and configuration

These capabilities compress developer cycles. A task that required reading dozens of files, understanding dependencies, and writing careful patches can happen in a single agent run.

That speed is the point.

It is also the source of a new control problem.

## What coding agents do not control

A coding agent is optimized to finish work. It is not designed to answer:

- **How much has this run already spent?**
- **Is this tenant allowed to consume more?**
- **Should this workflow downgrade to a cheaper model?**
- **Has cumulative retry cost exceeded the budget for this task?**
- **Should execution stop because a parent scope is exhausted?**

These are not questions about code quality or correctness. They are questions about whether autonomous execution is still authorized to continue.

Most coding agents have no built-in mechanism to answer them.

## The gap between execution and authority

The distinction matters because coding agents create real cost as they run:

- **LLM inference** — every model call costs tokens
- **Tool invocations** — code search, file reads, web lookups, and API calls accumulate
- **Retries** — failed steps retry, sometimes silently, multiplying spend
- **Fan-out** — a single high-level task can expand into dozens of subtasks
- **Long-running loops** — agents that iterate on test failures or linting errors can run indefinitely

Without runtime budget authority, the only control is to wait until the run finishes — or until someone notices the bill.

That is observability, not enforcement.

## Why provider caps and rate limits are not enough

Provider-level spending caps and rate limits are useful safety nets, but they solve a different problem.

**Rate limits** bound how fast a system can act. They do not bound how much total exposure a system creates over time.

**Provider caps** are global kill switches. They apply to all usage across all tenants and workflows — they cannot express "this tenant may spend $50 on this run" or "this agent may use 100,000 tokens for this task."

**In-app counters** are fragile under concurrency. Two agents checking the same counter simultaneously can both proceed, creating double-spend that is only visible after the fact.

Coding agents need controls that are:

- **scoped** — per tenant, per workspace, per run, per agent
- **pre-authorized** — checked before execution, not after
- **concurrency-safe** — correct under parallel agent execution
- **reconciled** — actual usage committed, unused budget released

## What runtime budget authority looks like

Runtime budget authority introduces a control loop around autonomous execution:

1. **Reserve** — before work begins, declare estimated cost and reserve budget against one or more scopes
2. **Execute** — proceed only if reservation succeeds
3. **Commit** — report actual usage after work completes (unused remainder is released automatically)
4. **Release** — explicitly release budget if work is canceled

This is the [reserve/commit model](/protocol/how-reserve-commit-works-in-cycles) that Cycles implements.

For coding agents, this means:

- a run can check whether budget is available before starting
- each model call or tool invocation can debit against a scoped budget
- retries consume from the same reservation, preventing unbounded cost
- if the budget is exhausted, the agent receives a clear signal to stop or degrade
- operators see real-time budget consumption, not just post-hoc bills

## Scoped budgets for multi-tenant platforms

Teams running coding agents for multiple tenants or users face a harder version of this problem.

A single global cap does not help when:

- tenant A should be allowed $100/day but tenant B only $20/day
- a specific workspace within a tenant has its own limit
- one agent run should not consume more than 50% of a tenant's remaining budget

Cycles supports [hierarchical scoped budgets](/protocol/api-reference-for-the-cycles-protocol) — budgets defined at any level of a scope tree (tenant, workspace, project, run). A single reservation checks all applicable scopes atomically.

This means a coding agent running inside a multi-tenant platform can be governed by organizational policy without any custom enforcement logic in the agent itself.

## Events for direct-debit accounting

Not all coding agent work fits the reservation pattern. Some actions have a known cost at execution time — a fixed-price API call, a per-file processing fee, a flat-rate tool invocation.

For these, Cycles supports [events](/protocol/how-events-work-in-cycles-direct-debit-without-reservation) — direct-debit operations that atomically deduct from scoped budgets without a prior reservation.

Events give coding agent platforms a way to account for every unit of work, whether or not it was estimated in advance.

## The practical takeaway

Coding agents are getting faster, cheaper, and more autonomous.

That makes runtime budget authority more important, not less.

Keep building capable agents. But do not assume that the agent itself is the right place to enforce spending limits, tenant isolation, or organizational policy.

Those are infrastructure concerns. They belong in a control layer that is:

- **independent** of the agent's execution logic
- **atomic** under concurrency
- **hierarchical** across organizational scopes
- **reconciled** between estimated and actual cost

That is the problem Cycles exists to solve.

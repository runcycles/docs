# Self-Hosting the Cycles Server

The Cycles server is a Spring Boot application that enforces budget reservations backed by Redis. This guide covers how to run it locally, with Docker, and in production.

::: tip Looking for the full deployment walkthrough?
See [Deploying the Full Cycles Stack](/quickstart/deploying-the-full-cycles-stack) for an end-to-end guide that covers the admin server, tenant setup, API key creation, budget allocation, and verification — everything you need from zero to a working deployment.
:::

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for the quick path — no Java needed), or
- **Java 21+** and **Maven 3.9+** (for building from source)
- **Redis 7+** (required for Lua script compatibility)

## Quick start with Docker Compose

### Using pre-built GHCR images (recommended)

The fastest way to get the Cycles server running. No Java or Maven required:

```bash
cd cycles-server
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This pulls `ghcr.io/runcycles/cycles-server:latest` and starts it with Redis.

::: tip Pinning versions
Replace `:latest` with a specific version tag (e.g., `:0.1.23.3`) in `docker-compose.prod.yml` for reproducible deployments.
:::

### Building from source with Docker

The repository includes a multi-stage Dockerfile that builds the JAR inside Docker — no local Java or Maven needed:

```bash
cd cycles-server
docker compose up -d
```

This uses `docker-compose.yml` which builds from source via the multi-stage Dockerfile.

### Full stack (with Admin Server)

To run both the Cycles Server and Admin Server together:

```bash
cd cycles-server
docker compose -f docker-compose.full-stack.yml up -d       # build from source
docker compose -f docker-compose.full-stack.prod.yml up -d   # use GHCR images
```

The full-stack compose files expect `cycles-server-admin` to be cloned alongside as a sibling directory.

The server is available at `http://localhost:7878`.

Verify it is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7878/actuator/health
```

## Running from source

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-server.git
cd cycles-server/cycles-protocol-service
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Start Redis (if not already running):

```bash
redis-server
```

Run the server:

```bash
java -jar cycles-protocol-service-api/target/cycles-protocol-service-api-*.jar
```

The server starts on port 7878 by default.

## Configuration

The server is configured via environment variables or `application.properties`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `REDIS_HOST` | `localhost` | Redis server hostname |
| `REDIS_PORT` | `6379` | Redis server port |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | (empty) | Redis password (optional) |
| `server.port` | `7878` | HTTP server port |
| `cycles.expiry.interval-ms` | `5000` | Interval for the background reservation expiry sweep (ms) |

### Full application properties

```properties
# Server
server.port=7878

# Redis
redis.host=${REDIS_HOST:localhost}
redis.port=${REDIS_PORT:6379}
redis.password=${REDIS_PASSWORD:}

# JSON serialization
spring.jackson.serialization.write-dates-as-timestamps=false
spring.jackson.deserialization.fail-on-unknown-properties=true
spring.jackson.default-property-inclusion=non_null

# Reservation expiry sweep interval
cycles.expiry.interval-ms=5000

# Logging
logging.level.root=INFO
logging.level.io.runcycles.protocol=DEBUG

# OpenAPI / Swagger UI
springdoc.api-docs.path=/api-docs
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true

# Actuator
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
management.endpoint.health.show-details=when-authorized
```

## Redis connection

The server uses a JedisPool with a default maximum of 50 connections. Redis 7+ is required because the Lua scripts use features not available in earlier versions.

### Redis with authentication

Set the `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable:

```bash
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-redis-password java -jar cycles-protocol-service-api-*.jar
```

### Redis connection pool

The default pool configuration uses 50 max connections, which is sufficient for most workloads. For high-throughput deployments, tune the pool size by modifying the `RedisConfig` class or providing a custom `JedisPool` bean.

## Background expiry sweep

The server runs a background task every 5 seconds (configurable via `cycles.expiry.interval-ms`) that:

1. Scans the reservation TTL sorted set for expired entries
2. Marks expired reservations as `EXPIRED`
3. Releases their reserved budget back to the affected scopes

This ensures abandoned reservations (from crashed clients or network failures) do not permanently consume budget.

## Health checks

The server exposes Spring Boot Actuator health endpoints:

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:7878/actuator/health

# Detailed health (when authorized)
curl http://localhost:7878/actuator/health
```

## Swagger UI

The server includes interactive API documentation via Swagger UI:

```
http://localhost:7878/swagger-ui.html
```

The raw OpenAPI spec is available at:

```
http://localhost:7878/api-docs
```

## Production considerations

### Stateless server

The Cycles server is stateless — all state lives in Redis. You can run multiple server instances behind a load balancer without sticky sessions.

### Redis persistence

Enable Redis persistence (RDB or AOF) to survive Redis restarts without losing budget state. For production:

```
# redis.conf
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
```

### Redis memory

Budget data is compact. Each scope stores a few counters. Each active reservation stores its metadata. Typical memory usage is low unless you have millions of concurrent reservations.

### Security

- Always run the server behind HTTPS in production (use a reverse proxy like nginx or a cloud load balancer)
- Use strong, unique API keys per tenant
- Set `REDIS_PASSWORD` and restrict Redis network access
- Consider running Redis in a private subnet not accessible from the internet

### Scaling

For higher throughput:

- Add more Cycles server instances behind a load balancer
- Use Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling of budget state
- Tune the JedisPool connection count based on your concurrency needs

## Verifying your deployment

After starting the server, verify the full lifecycle works. You need an API key and a budget already configured via the [Cycles Admin Server](/quickstart/deploying-the-full-cycles-stack):

```bash
# Create a reservation (requires a valid API key and budget for the tenant scope)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:7878/v1/reservations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Cycles-API-Key: $CYCLES_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "idempotency_key": "test-001",
    "subject": { "tenant": "acme-corp" },
    "action": { "kind": "test", "name": "verify" },
    "estimate": { "amount": 100, "unit": "USD_MICROCENTS" }
  }'
```

If the server is configured correctly, you will receive a JSON response with a `reservation_id` and `"decision": "ALLOW"`.

If you get `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`, you need to create a budget via the admin server first. If you get `UNAUTHORIZED`, verify your API key was created correctly. See the [full stack deployment guide](/quickstart/deploying-the-full-cycles-stack) for the complete bootstrap sequence.

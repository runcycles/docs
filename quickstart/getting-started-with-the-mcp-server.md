# Getting Started with the Cycles MCP Server

[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@runcycles/mcp-server?label=MCP%20Server%20downloads&color=555&style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@runcycles/mcp-server)

The Cycles MCP Server gives any MCP-compatible AI agent runtime authority. Instead of integrating an SDK into your application code, you add the MCP server to your agent's tool configuration and the agent gets direct access to budget tools — reserve, commit, release, check balance, and more.

This is the fastest way to add budget awareness to an AI agent. One config change, zero code changes.

## Prerequisites

You need a running Cycles stack with a tenant, API key, and budget. If you don't have one yet, follow [Deploy the Full Stack](/quickstart/deploying-the-full-cycles-stack) first.

::: tip Where do I get my API key?
API keys are created through the **Cycles Admin Server** (port 7979) and always start with `cyc_live_`. If your stack is already running with a tenant, create one directly:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:7979/v1/admin/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Admin-API-Key: admin-bootstrap-key" \
  -d '{
    "tenant_id": "acme-corp",
    "name": "mcp-key",
    "permissions": ["reservations:create","reservations:commit","reservations:release","reservations:extend","reservations:list","balances:read","decide","events:create"]
  }' | jq -r '.key_secret'
```

The response returns the full key (e.g. `cyc_live_abc123...`). **Save it — the secret is only shown once.**

Need the full setup? See [Deploy the Full Stack — Create an API key](/quickstart/deploying-the-full-cycles-stack#step-3-create-an-api-key). For rotation and lifecycle details, see [API Key Management](/how-to/api-key-management-in-cycles).

## Setup

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cycles": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@runcycles/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CYCLES_API_KEY": "cyc_live_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add cycles -- npx -y @runcycles/mcp-server
```

Set your API key in the environment:

```bash
export CYCLES_API_KEY=cyc_live_...
```

### Cursor / Windsurf

Use the stdio transport with:

```yaml
command: npx
args: ["-y", "@runcycles/mcp-server"]
env: { CYCLES_API_KEY: "cyc_live_..." }
```

### Mock mode (local development)

To try the server without a Cycles backend, enable mock mode. Mock mode returns realistic responses with deterministic data — no API key or running server needed.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cycles": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@runcycles/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CYCLES_MOCK": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Your first budget check

Once connected, ask your agent to check a budget balance:

> "Check the budget balance for tenant acme-corp"

The agent will call `cycles_check_balance` with `tenant: "acme-corp"` and return balances for all scopes under that tenant — remaining budget, reserved amounts, and total spent.

## The reserve/commit lifecycle

The core pattern is **reserve → execute → commit**. Here's how it works through MCP tools:

**Step 1 — Reserve** before doing something expensive:

> "Reserve 500,000 USD_MICROCENTS for an OpenAI GPT-4o call"

The agent calls `cycles_reserve` and gets back a `reservation_id` and a `decision`. If the decision is `ALLOW`, the budget is locked and the agent can proceed.

**Step 2 — Execute** the operation (the LLM call, API request, etc.)

**Step 3 — Commit** actual usage:

> "Commit reservation res_abc123 with actual usage 423,100 USD_MICROCENTS"

The agent calls `cycles_commit` with the `reservation_id` and the actual amount. The difference between the reserved estimate and the actual usage is returned to the budget pool.

If the operation fails or is cancelled, the agent calls `cycles_release` instead to return the full reserved amount.

## Handling decisions

When you call `cycles_reserve` or `cycles_decide`, the server returns one of three decisions:

| Decision | Meaning | Agent should… |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `ALLOW` | Budget is available, proceed normally | Execute the operation |
| `ALLOW_WITH_CAPS` | Budget is tight, proceed with constraints | Reduce scope — use a cheaper model, fewer tokens, or skip optional tools. The `caps` field contains `maxTokens`, `toolAllowlist`, and `cooldownMs` hints |
| `DENY` | Budget exhausted or insufficient | Stop, inform the user, or switch to a free fallback |

## Available tools

The MCP server exposes 9 tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cycles_reserve` | Reserve budget before a costly operation. Returns a reservation ID and decision |
| `cycles_commit` | Commit actual usage after an operation completes. Records actual usage against the budget |
| `cycles_release` | Release a reservation without committing. Returns budget to the pool |
| `cycles_extend` | Extend the TTL of an active reservation (heartbeat for long-running ops) |
| `cycles_decide` | Lightweight preflight check — ask if an action would be allowed without reserving |
| `cycles_check_balance` | Check current budget balance for a scope |
| `cycles_list_reservations` | List reservations, filtered by status or subject |
| `cycles_get_reservation` | Get details of a specific reservation by ID |
| `cycles_create_event` | Record usage directly without reserve/commit (fire-and-forget) |

## Built-in prompts

The server includes 3 prompts that agents can invoke for guided workflows:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `integrate_cycles` | Generate reserve/commit/release patterns for a specific language and use case |
| `diagnose_overrun` | Analyze budget exhaustion — guides through checking balances and listing reservations |
| `design_budget_strategy` | Recommend scope hierarchy, limits, units, and degradation strategy for a workflow |

## Configuration reference

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CYCLES_API_KEY` | *(required)* | API key for authenticating with the Cycles server |
| `CYCLES_BASE_URL` | `https://api.runcycles.io` | Base URL of the Cycles API |
| `CYCLES_MOCK` | — | Set to `"true"` to use mock mode (no server needed) |
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP port when using `--transport http` |

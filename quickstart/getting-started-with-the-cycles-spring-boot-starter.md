# Getting Started with the Cycles Spring Boot Starter

The Cycles Spring Boot Starter provides a declarative way to add budget enforcement to any Spring application.

Instead of manually calling the Cycles API for every reservation, commit, and release, the starter provides an `@Cycles` annotation that handles the full lifecycle automatically.

> **Using Python?** See the [Python Client quickstart](/quickstart/getting-started-with-the-python-client) instead.

## What the starter does

The starter wraps any annotated method in a reserve → execute → commit lifecycle:

1. **Before the method runs:** evaluates the estimate, creates a reservation, and checks the decision
2. **While the method runs:** maintains the reservation with automatic heartbeat extensions
3. **After the method returns:** commits actual usage and releases any unused remainder
4. **If the method throws:** releases the reservation to return budget to the pool

All of this happens transparently through Spring AOP.

## Try the demo app first

The fastest way to see the starter in action is to run the included demo application.

### Prerequisites

You need a running Cycles stack with a tenant, API key, and budget. If you don't have one yet, follow [Deploy the Full Stack](/quickstart/deploying-the-full-cycles-stack) first. The demo app expects the same `acme-corp` tenant used in that guide.

### Run the demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runcycles/cycles-spring-boot-starter.git
cd cycles-spring-boot-starter/cycles-demo-client-java-spring
```

Set your API key (the one you created in the deployment guide):

```bash
export CYCLES_API_KEY=cyc_live_...
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or edit `application.yml` directly and paste the key in `cycles.api-key`.

The demo app starts on port 7955. Try the simplest example first:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7955/api/demo/annotation/minimal?input=hello
```

Hit `GET http://localhost:7955/api/demo/index` for a full listing of all endpoints with copy-paste curl commands.

### What the demo covers

The demo app includes working examples for every major feature area:

**Start here (`/api/demo/annotation/minimal`)**
- `@Cycles("1000")` — the simplest possible usage, fixed estimate with all defaults

**Annotation-based (`/api/llm/*`)**
- `@Cycles` with SpEL estimate/actual, `CyclesContextHolder` for reading reservation context, `CyclesMetrics` for reporting token counts and latency, and `commitMetadata` for audit data

**Annotation variations (`/api/demo/annotation/*`)**
- `ALLOW_WITH_CAPS` — reading and respecting server-imposed constraints — `POST /api/demo/annotation/caps`
- `unit=TOKENS` with `actionTags` — `POST /api/demo/annotation/tokens`
- `unit=CREDITS` with `workflow`, `agent`, and custom `dimensions` — `POST /api/demo/annotation/credits`
- `overagePolicy=ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT` — `POST /api/demo/annotation/overdraft`
- Custom `ttlMs` and `gracePeriodMs` — `POST /api/demo/annotation/custom-ttl`
- `dryRun=true` (shadow-mode evaluation) — `POST /api/demo/annotation/dry-run`

**Programmatic CyclesClient (`/api/demo/client/*`)**
- Full reserve → commit lifecycle — `POST /api/demo/client/reserve-commit`
- Reserve → release (cancellation) — `POST /api/demo/client/reserve-release`
- Preflight decision check — `POST /api/demo/client/decide`
- Balance queries — `GET /api/demo/client/balances`
- Reservation listing — `GET /api/demo/client/reservations`

**Standalone events (`/api/demo/events/*`)**
- Direct debit without reservation — `POST /api/demo/events/record`

**Error handling**
- Global `@RestControllerAdvice` for `CyclesProtocolException` with structured JSON error responses

> **Note:** The deployment guide creates a `USD_MICROCENTS` budget. The `unit=TOKENS` and `unit=CREDITS` demo endpoints require separate budget ledgers for those units. If you only created the default budget, those endpoints will return `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`. Start with the `USD_MICROCENTS` endpoints (minimal, caps, overdraft, custom-ttl, dry-run) and create additional budgets via the admin API if you want to explore other units.

### Suggested walkthrough

Follow this order to build understanding progressively. Each step introduces one new concept.

**1. Reserve and commit with a fixed estimate**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7955/api/demo/annotation/minimal?input=hello
```

This is `@Cycles("1000")` — the simplest annotation. The response shows the reservation lifecycle result.

**2. Check your balance**

```bash
curl http://localhost:7955/api/demo/client/balances
```

You should see `spent` increased by 1000 microcents from step 1.

**3. Try a dry run (no budget consumed)**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7955/api/demo/annotation/dry-run?amount=500
```

The server evaluates the reservation but doesn't persist it. Check balances again — they haven't changed.

**4. See how overdraft works**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7955/api/demo/annotation/overdraft?amount=1000
```

With `overagePolicy=ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT`, the reservation succeeds even if it exceeds the budget.

**5. Use the programmatic client**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7955/api/demo/client/reserve-commit?estimate=5000
```

This does the same reserve → commit lifecycle as `@Cycles`, but using `CyclesClient` directly. Compare with step 1 to see the annotation vs programmatic approach.

**6. Cancel a reservation**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7955/api/demo/client/reserve-release?estimate=3000
```

The reservation is created then released — budget is returned to the pool. Check balances to confirm it was refunded.

**7. Preflight check without reserving**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7955/api/demo/client/decide?estimate=10000
```

The `decide` endpoint tells you whether a reservation *would* be allowed, without creating one.

**8. Record a standalone event**

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7955/api/demo/events/record?amount=1500&description=API+call'
```

Direct debit — no reservation needed. Useful for post-hoc accounting.

After this walkthrough, explore the remaining endpoints (`caps`, `custom-ttl`, `llm/generate`) and read the source files below to see how each feature is implemented.

## Configuration

Add the starter dependency and configure the connection in your project's `application.yml`:

```yaml
cycles:
  base-url: https://your-cycles-server.example.com
  api-key: your-api-key
  tenant: acme
  workspace: production
  app: support-bot
```

These defaults apply to all `@Cycles`-annotated methods unless overridden per method.

### Optional configuration

```yaml
cycles:
  http:
    connect-timeout: 2s
    read-timeout: 5s
  retry:
    enabled: true
    max-attempts: 5
    initial-delay: 500ms
    multiplier: 2.0
    max-delay: 30s
```

## The @Cycles annotation

The `@Cycles` annotation is applied to methods:

```java
@Cycles("500")
public String summarize(String text) {
    return chatModel.call(text);
}
```

This reserves 500 units (default unit: USD_MICROCENTS) before `summarize()` runs, then commits actual usage afterward.

### SpEL expressions for dynamic estimates

The estimate can use Spring Expression Language to compute cost from method arguments:

```java
@Cycles("#tokens * 10")
public String generate(int tokens) {
    return chatModel.call(prompt, tokens);
}
```

The expression is evaluated before the method runs, using method parameters as variables.

### Specifying actual cost

By default, the estimate is used as the actual cost at commit time. To calculate actual cost from the return value:

```java
@Cycles(estimate = "5000", actual = "#result.usage.totalTokens * 8")
public ChatResponse chat(String prompt) {
    return chatModel.call(prompt);
}
```

The `actual` expression is evaluated after the method returns, with `#result` bound to the return value.

## Annotation attributes

### Subject fields

Override the defaults from configuration:

```java
@Cycles(value = "1000",
         tenant = "acme",
         workspace = "production",
         app = "support-bot",
         workflow = "refund-assistant",
         agent = "planner",
         toolset = "search-tools")
```

### Action identity

```java
@Cycles(value = "1000",
         actionKind = "llm.completion",
         actionName = "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
         actionTags = {"prod", "customer-facing"})
```

If not specified, `actionKind` defaults to the declaring class name and `actionName` defaults to the method name.

### Unit

```java
@Cycles(value = "2500", unit = "TOKENS")
```

Supported units: `USD_MICROCENTS` (default), `TOKENS`, `CREDITS`, `RISK_POINTS`.

### TTL and grace period

```java
@Cycles(value = "1000", ttlMs = 30000, gracePeriodMs = 10000)
```

Default TTL is 60 seconds. The starter automatically sends heartbeat extensions at `ttlMs / 2` intervals.

### Overage policy

```java
@Cycles(value = "1000", overagePolicy = "ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE")
```

Options: `REJECT` (default), `ALLOW_IF_AVAILABLE`, `ALLOW_WITH_OVERDRAFT`.

### Dry run (shadow mode)

```java
@Cycles(value = "1000", dryRun = true)
```

Evaluates the reservation without actually holding budget. Useful for shadow-mode rollouts.

### Custom dimensions

```java
@Cycles(value = "1000", dimensions = {"cost_center=engineering", "run=run-12345"})
```

## Accessing reservation context at runtime

Inside an annotated method, the current reservation context is available via `CyclesContextHolder`:

```java
@Cycles("1000")
public String process(String input) {
    CyclesReservationContext ctx = CyclesContextHolder.get();

    // Check reservation details
    String reservationId = ctx.getReservationId();
    Decision decision = ctx.getDecision();

    // Check caps (if ALLOW_WITH_CAPS)
    if (ctx.hasCaps()) {
        Caps caps = ctx.getCaps();
        Integer maxTokens = caps.getMaxTokens();
        if (!caps.isToolAllowed("web.search")) {
            // skip web search
        }
    }

    // Check expiration
    if (ctx.isExpiringSoon(5000)) {
        // wrap up quickly
    }

    // Attach metrics for the commit
    CyclesMetrics metrics = new CyclesMetrics();
    metrics.setTokensInput(150);
    metrics.setTokensOutput(80);
    metrics.setLatencyMs(320);
    metrics.setModelVersion("gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18");
    ctx.setMetrics(metrics);

    // Attach metadata for audit
    ctx.setCommitMetadata(Map.of("request_id", "req-abc-123"));

    return chatModel.call(input);
}
```

## Decision handling

When the reservation decision comes back, the starter handles each case:

### ALLOW

The method runs normally.

### ALLOW_WITH_CAPS

The method runs, and a warning is logged. Caps are available through `CyclesContextHolder` for the method to inspect and respect.

### DENY

The method does not run. A `CyclesProtocolException` is thrown with the reason code and optional `retryAfterMs` hint.

The caller can catch this to implement degradation:

```java
try {
    return service.summarize(text);
} catch (CyclesProtocolException e) {
    if (e.getRetryAfterMs() != null) {
        // retry after suggested delay
    }
    return fallbackResponse();
}
```

## Nesting prevention

The starter does not allow nested `@Cycles` annotations. If method A is annotated with `@Cycles` and calls method B which is also annotated, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

This prevents double-reservation and ensures each budget lifecycle is clear and isolated.

## Commit retry

If the commit fails due to a transient error (network issue, 5xx response), the starter can retry automatically.

The retry engine is configurable and extensible. The default implementation uses exponential backoff based on the retry configuration.

Custom retry strategies can be provided by implementing the `CommitRetryEngine` interface.

## Lifecycle summary

For each `@Cycles`-annotated method call:

1. Estimate is evaluated (SpEL expression or fixed value)
2. Reservation is created on the Cycles server
3. Decision is checked (ALLOW / ALLOW_WITH_CAPS / DENY)
4. If DENY: throw exception, method does not run
5. Heartbeat extension is scheduled (background thread)
6. Method executes
7. Actual cost is evaluated (SpEL expression or estimate)
8. Commit is sent with actual amount and optional metrics
9. Heartbeat is cancelled
10. If method threw: reservation is released instead of committed

## Summary

The Cycles Spring Boot Starter turns budget enforcement into a single annotation:

- `@Cycles("estimate")` wraps any method in a reserve → execute → commit lifecycle
- SpEL expressions provide dynamic cost estimation
- Heartbeat extensions keep reservations alive for long-running operations
- Caps, metrics, and metadata are accessible through `CyclesContextHolder`
- DENY decisions throw catchable exceptions for degradation handling
- Commit retry handles transient failures automatically

This gives Spring applications production-grade budget enforcement with minimal code changes.
